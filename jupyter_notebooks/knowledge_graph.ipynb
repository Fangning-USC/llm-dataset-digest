Outlook: CTV and SOVs, our review of service vessel activity during Q4 2022 in relation to Q4 2021.\\nUnfortunately, demand for CTVs was not good during 2022.\\nIn Q4, there was a significant increase in work but not enough to make up the shortfall in the market during the previous months of the year.\\nDespite this, investment in vessels has remained high, with 28 new CTVs delivered globally last year, making a pipeline of over 50 for 2023 and beyond.\\nIn a new development, our report now includes analysis of walk to work (W2W) vessel activity in offshore wind.\\nPreviously, our focus was on SOVs and CSOVs, which provide a niche area of vessel supply.\\nHowever, they are now competing more and more with other offshore support vessels (OSVs), especially those with W2W systems installed.\\nFor this reason, it is appropriate to include these vessels, to provide a context for the built-for-market SOVs.\\nThe good news is that, while this is the first time the analysis has been carried out, we have been tracking W2W OSVs for a number of years, so are able to bring this to you.\\nIf you have any comments about this report or suggests for future subjects, please contact us and we will look to include these and answer any questions you might have.\\nThis document has been prepared in good faith on the basis of information available at the date of publication.\\n4C

connected via energy islands by 2040.\\nUp to 3.8 GW to be connected to Bornholm around 2030 and the first 3 GW phase of the North Sea project by 2033.\\nAn additional 6 GW is anticipated by 2030, for which 4C has slightly staggered start dates to account for potential delays.\\nOpen Door applications increased significantly in Summer 2022, but permit processing has been slow, so only a small proportion is included in the forecast.\\nFrance is targeting net-zero by 2050, with 33% renewable generation by 2030.\\nAs part of a Sector Deal, the government announced further targets: annual tender volumes increased from 1 to 2 GW from 2025; awarding 20 GW by 2030; with 18 GW operational by 2035 and 40 GW by 2050.\\nFrance has awarded 3.6 GW of offshore wind due to be operational by 2022-2025.\\nThe energy program (PPE 2019-2028) targets at least 5.8 GW operational by 2028.\\nHowever, France is projected to miss targets due in part to COVID impact on public debates and tenders, and long project lead times.\\nThe French government is continuing legislative amendments to reduce lead times.\\nAn updated tender schedule is anticipated in the next PPE update in 2024.\\nGermany has set minimum targets of 30 GW by 2030, 40 GW by 2035, and 70 GW by 2045 but has additional goals to exceed targets and reach 50 GW by 2035.\\nHowever, the latest draft FEP does not specify locations or connections beyond 2032 and in previous drafts TSOs have been critical of feasibility.\\n4C has slightly staggered start dates to account for potential delays during consenting and construction given tight timeframes and pressure on the European supply chain towards the end of the decade.\\n4C also assumes a more conservative model to 2035 due to current lack of visibility.\\nThe Netherlands published an expanded 2030+ roadmap, doubling previous ambition to 21 GW by 2032 (9 TWh), to meet 75% of domestic electricity demand.\\n4C has slightly staggered start dates into the next decade to account for potential delays during consenting and construction given tight timeframes and pressure on European supply chain towards the end of the decade.\\nFuture scenarios for energy systems (supply and demand) and the North Sea Energy Outlook (NSEO) indicate that 38-72 GW of offshore wind will be required in 2050.\\n4C has also modelled a growth rate of 1.5 GW/year post-2030 as per NSEO.\\nA new roadmap to 2040 will be published in 2023.\\nThe United Kingdom has a net-zero 2050 target, estimated to require 65-125 GW of offshore wind (CCC ‘balanced pathway’ scenario).\\nThe Q1 2022 Energy Security Strategy accelerates short-term ambition to 50 GW by 2030, including 5 GW of floating wind, plus 5 GW of green hydrogen.\\nPolicies to encourage acceleration include annual CfD auctions from March 2023 and fast-track consenting.\\nThere is a large appetite for the UK seabed.\\nChallenges include lengthy permitting and CfD auction delays, supply chains, legal challenges to projects, grid connections, and transmission charging.\\nCountry Outlooks: Established European Markets * Capacity installed or foundation installation underway

its first permits to lease state waters for offshore wind.\\nThere are already some small installations in place.\\nInitial build-out is limited to a few projects, mostly centrally-led, with auctions expected from 2024.\\nÅland is being heavily promoted as a location for large-scale offshore wind and possible hydrogen, not expected until the 2030s.\\nThe process for Åland is being worked out but has strong political support across parties.\\n2 GW by 2030 0.25 Greece: The government approved Greece’s first offshore wind framework and is targeting 2 GW by 2030.\\nThe country has no offshore wind currently and it remains to be seen how quickly the government can issue necessary decrees and design the auction system.\\nFor these reasons, the 4C forecast is lower than targets.\\nIreland published final terms and conditions for ORESS-1, confirming 2.5 GW available.\\nWhile developers have more confidence, progress remains slow and faces supply chain constraints.\\nRelevant Project developers have opportunity to submit consent applications H2 2023.\\nGovernment recognizes only ORESS-1 and -2 will contribute to the 2030 target.\\nWinners of ORESS-1 to be announced mid-2023 – all relevant projects eligible Interest in Ireland remains buoyant, leading to a significant pipeline, but delays lead to low confidence that the target will be reached.\\nPost-2030, 4C models a steady build-out as the market and supply chain develops and matures.\\nInvestment in port infrastructure is needed to meet target.\\nItaly set to develop 3.5 to 5 GW offshore wind by 2030 in the draft of the FER 2 decree., but this has been repeatedly delayed, reducing confidence in the market.\\nAuctions that were due to start in 2022 will not be able to start before FER 2 issuance and is expected to start in 2023 at the earliest.\\n30 MW currently in operation.\\nAs the market matures and the first auctions begin, timelines in Italy will become clearer, meaning targets may be raised in the future.\\nThe Lithuanian Ministry of Energy has announced intentions to begin a centrally tendered auction for 700 MW in Q1 2023.\\nProject capacity and subsidy mechanisms are not yet enacted into law.\\nAn additional 700 MW delivered post-2030 is planned for in Lithuania’s NECP.\\nIn 2023, Norway intends to lease the first 1.5 GW phase of Sørlige Nordsjø II (1.5 GW, with a further 1.5 GW phase to follow).\\nThis will include site and CfD.\\nUtsira Nord, 3 x 500 MW of floating wind, will be allocated based on qualitative criteria, starting late 2023.\\nSite investigations still need to be completed and published.\\n4C estimates construction of two phases before 2030, and two post-2030.\\nThe initial phase of SNII will connect to the Norwegian grid, with future phases potentially connecting to other countries such as Germany.\\nNorway is targeting 30 GW leased by 2040, but the government projects 9 years from announcement of areas to consent, so build-out will trail this date.\\nCountry Outlooks: Emerging European Markets  Brazil: The government’s energy plan includes 16 GW by 2050 but this is not a formal goal.\\nIt is unclear how the new administration will approach offshore wind.\\nDecree 10.946 regulates the construction and operation of offshore wind projects in Brazilian waters, including domestic and territorial waters, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and on the continental shelf.\\nThe Ministry of Mines and Energy has published draft rules for auctions legislative framework for auctions needs to be worked out, and the framework is not expected before 2023.\\n4C anticipates a slow initial build-out, concentrated around key large ports that may make green hydrogen attractive United States: Federal-level targets include 30 GW by 2030 and net-zero by 2050.\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act translates ambition to policy and federal support The Department of the Interior has accelerated its leasing and consenting activities.\\nHowever, an immature supply chain and port and grid infrastructure requirements may see some delays.\\nState targets getting bigger and longer-term, driving progress.\\nNew York is expected to double its 9 GW by 2035 goal, while most recently California announced a 25 GW by 2045 target.\\nFixed-bottom wind on the east coast will build out first, followed by deeper floating wind in the Gulfs of Maine and Mexico, and the west coast into the 2030s.\\nFirst floating leases auctioned in Q4 2022.\\nPoland: The National Energy Plan 2040 (PEP 2040) targets 5.9 GW by 2030 and 11 GW by 2040.\\nIn 2021, 5.9 GW was allocated by CfD and these projects will likely be in construction by 2030.\\nThere will be further 2.5 GW auctions in 2025 and 2027.\\nAmendments have been made to the Offshore Act, to tackle the permitting challenges which developers are currently experiencing.\\n4C expects that commissioned capacity will fall short for the 2030 target, but 11 GW by 2040 is feasible with the development of supply chain and infrastructure.\\nSpain’s Spain’s Draft roadmap sets the first national offshore wind target as 1-3 GW offshore wind by 2030, the majority of which will be floating.\\nThe Canary Islands presented an Energy Strategy for Offshore Wind in April 2022, targeting 2.4 GW by 2040.\\nMarine spatial plans and regulatory framework was due to be finalised by the end of 2022, with the first auction expected in Q1 2023.\\n4C models buildout in anticipation of upcoming offshore wind tenders, which could see 1.4 GW by 2030 and 2.4 GW by 2035.\\nSweden aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2040 but no official target for offshore wind.\\nTo meet the 100% target, the Swedish Energy Agency anticipates 10-45 TWh of offshore wind.\\nTSO Svenska Kraftnät has found that Sweden needs between three and six new grid connection points for new build-out, focusing first around Skåne.\\nNo support scheme exists as yet, and coupled with the government’s strategy to push for nuclear energy, market uncertainty is high.\\nAustralia: Government aims to increase renewable electricity generation from 29% [2021] to 82% by 2030 and net zero by 2050.\\nVictoria is the first state to set offshore wind targets, for at least 2 GW by 2032, with a procurement round in mid-2020s and first power in 2028, and 4 GW by 2035.\\nThere is a growing project pipeline of over 40 GW.\\nA new federal licensing framework for Commonwealth waters came into force June 2022 and the government has started the process for identifying suitable areas.\\nClarity is needed around offtake schemes and supply chain development.\\n4C has modelled buildout to 2035 but all project details are illustrative, dependent on federal and state progress, and supply chain development.\\nChina: Following a large build-out in 2021, 4C expects a short-term slow-down until there is clarity on provincial level subsidy mechanisms and targets.\\nBy the end of 2022, the total installed capacity of offshore wind power in China is expected to reach 30 GW, an increase of ~4GW compared to 2021.\\nRegional governments are announcing 14th Five-Year Plans and have released some competitive allocation projects and sites and targets.\\nSeveral provinces have added multiple GW targets for grid connection by 2025 and 2030.\\nDue to nature of five-year plans, there is limited visibility for long- term ambitions hence 4C anticipate a growing pipeline.\\nIndia has increased its already unrealistic 2030 target from 30 GW to 37 GW.\\nProgress is delayed due to a lack of funding and legal and political frameworks.\\nIndia’s first tender is expected to include 4 GW of potential capacity.\\nProjects will be given up to 7 years to assess sites.\\nGiven lead times for site studies and planning, 4C estimates that India will develop up to 4 GW offshore wind energy by 2035, with tenders in the mid-2020s.\\nJapan has tendered 1.7 GW of offshore wind to date, with 1.8 GW to be opened to tender in December 2022, and winners announced by end-2023.\\nA further 600 MW of projects, under the Ports and Harbours Act, are progressing, with commercial operation of all 600 MW expected by around 2026.\\nThe Round 3 auctions, which will take place in 2023/24 will account for an additional 1.8 to 2.2 GW of capacity.\\nSeveral floating wind developments, including single-turbine demos and the integrated Green Innovation Fund project, will bring up to 6.6 GW by 2030.\\nSouth Korea: The previous administration proposed a target of 12 GW of offshore wind by 2030.\\nThis is largely still achievable if the government implements one-stop shop permitting, thus reducing the lengthy consenting procedure, and depending on continued advances in floating technology (use of 15 MW turbines, dual turbine foundations, and achieving commercial scale floating in the country).\\nCurrent administration plans to reduce renewable energy targets in the near future.\\n4C currently forecasts 9 GW by 2030, which may go up or down depending on changes in energy planning.\\nTaiwan is targeting 5.6 GW by 2025, adding a further 1.5 GW per year between 2026 and 2035, reaching 20.6 GW by 2035 and 40-55 GW by 2050.\\nTaiwan is still hampered by its Covid related delays, despite speed of project progress being in the ascendency, the backlog may be too great to overcome by 2025 to meet the original aim.\\nAnticipated small scale floating demos towards 2030.\\nVietnam: The Eighth Power Development Plan (PDP8) is expected to include an offshore wind target of 7 GW by 2030.\\nPDP8 has been consistently delayed.\\n4C assumes further delays to policy, tendering, and construction processes.\\nAdditionally, grid constraints could cause delays and curtailment.\\nClarity is needed on regulations and support mechanisms, following the expiration of the feed-in-tariff (FiT) in October 2021.\\nWhen it comes to the number of vessels needed for support, the most important factor is the number of turbines.\\nThe capacity of individual turbines is increasing allowing project overall capacity to increase with a reduced number of turbines needed to achieve this.\\nCurrently the number of turbines being installed is out pacing the capacity increases – good news for vessel demand, as our last forecast showed.\\nThe chart below shows how the proportion of turbines supported by different strategies is changing.\\nSOVs are increasing their share of the market, which now around 35%.\\nThis is unsurprising as many near shore locations have been developed and future installations are further offshore.\\nStill a Place for a CTV Support Strategy As country targets and project development increases globally, O&M strategies need to evolve to maintain optimum efficiency.\\nThe chart below shows how, until around 2015, the majority of projects were supported by CTVs, and some with additional helicopter support.\\nBy 2020, the use of SOVs had steadily increased to around 40% of projects using a sea based option.\\nDespite the increasing use of larger vessels, there remains a significant role for CTVs.\\nOne support strategy has not grown: the fixed accommodation platform.\\nThere are a only two examples, DanTysk in Germany and Horns Rev 2 in Denmark.\\nThe Horns Rev project has a three-level accommodation platform that can accommodate up to 24 persons at a time.\\nIt has direct access to the transformer platform via an outer gangway.\\nPersonnel transfers are made by CTV, so still require vessel support.\\nHelicopters have also been used.\\nNEAR-TERM OUTLOOK 6-12 MONTHS FOR CTVs Seagreen is on track for full commissioning in May 2023, with Edda Brint scheduled to arrive in March.\\nNeart na Gaoithe is now forecast for completion in October 2024 when its CTVs support strategy will be in use.\\nDogger Bank A is underway, and the other Dogger Bank sites are in the pre- construction phase.\\nAn SOV have been booked for O&M work.\\nSofia is due to enter construction around July 2023 but, like the Dogger Bank sites, will rely on SOV support.\\nSaint-Nazaire reached full commissioning in November.\\nSaint-Brieuc, Fécamp, and Calvados remain on schedule, with commissioning by end of 2023.\\nSmaller projects Golfe du Lion, Provence Grand Large, and Groix & Belle-Île are in the pre-construction phase and due to commence offshore construction this year.\\nThe 30 MW EolMed is expected to start construction later this year.\\nVesterhav Nord/Syd remains the only project in pre-construction, with turbine installation scheduled to start in February.\\nAll 38 SGRE turbines have been installed on Kaskasi and full operations expected by the end of 2023.\\nArcadis Ost 1 has achieved first power, and completion also expected by end of the year.\\nBoth projects will have CTV support.\\nBaltic Eagle, Borkum Riffgrund 3, and Gode Wind 3 are still in the pre-construction phase.\\nGode Wind should commence its main offshore construction work in early 2023; the other projects will start later in 2023.\\nConstruction continues on the Hollandse Kust Zuid Holland I & II and III & IV projects, with both now generating power.\\nHollandse Kust Noord is under construction.\\nAll expect full commissioning in 2023 and all have CTV O&M strategies in place.\\nWindplanblauw (112 MW) is also underway and is support by CTVs.\\nIn Norway, Hywind Tampen is generating power and has W2W vessel support in place.\\nTwo small demo floating projects are underway in Spain.\\nBoth have CTV support.\\nSignificant proportion of CTV support Number of projects supported by O&M strategy over time SOV support increasing per turbine Number of turbines supported by O&M strategy over time  Vessels over 30m loa maintained the most consistent demand to the sector during the quieter winter months.\\nAlso unsurprisingly, the vessels in the 25m – 30m range also had the lowest decrease at ~9% fall.\\nThe number of vessels active in the 10-15m range fell from 62% of available vessels to 43%.\\nThis may seem a small proportion when it could be considered that larger vessels are more appropriate to winter work.\\nHowever, vessels are selected on their suitability for site conditions so the smaller vessels are already working near to shore or on inland projects such as Windpark Fryslân or Westermeerwind in the Netherlands.\\nCTV Market Overview: Q4 2022 Sub 20m loa vessels see largest fall in activity Number of contracted vessels by length Q4 2022 Vessels competing in the market increases by 5% YoY Number of vessels active in the sector from 2010 Number of Vessels Contracted and Supply Increasing While the supply of vessels to the market maintains its normal profile of busy summer periods with less work during winter months, the number of vessels with contracted to work in Q4 2022 was up by 19 on the same period in 2021 (below).\\nThis is positive news as the number of vessels competing work (right) also increased by 17 on the previous year.\\nThe number active includes 20 new build vessels, which have started operations in Europe in 2022, and Acta Marine’s Offshore Performer re-joined the sector during the year.\\nThere was also a decrease in the fleet.\\nDuring 2022, a further nine vessels were marked as ‘inactive’ as they had either not been working in offshore wind for over two years or were known to have been sold, now working in other industries.\\nFor example, Dalby Derwent has been sold to a Romanian operator and left offshore wind.\\nThe percentage of active vessels working fell from 66% in Q3 2022 to 55% in this quarter.\\nMarket shares of leading CTV operators Top Ten Improve YoY in Q4 The utilisation chart to the left shows that almost all the top 10 operators improved their fleet utilisation in Q4 2022 compared to last year.\\nThe exception is Turner Iceni.\\nHowever, that operator is carrying out a maintenance programme on its vessels, with some out of service for several weeks.\\nThe effect of the maintenance work can also be seen in the charts below left.\\nDespite the gains made by the top ten, other operators took a larger market share compared to Q3, up from 37% to 53%.\\nOn the next slide, it can be seen that this is the result of a more diverse supply in France and in the Netherlands.\\nWindcat and Njord Offshore increased the number of vessels in their fleets on charter (right), with an additional four and three vessels working respectively.\\nTwo more vessels on contract also helped to bring HST Marine up to seventh place.\\nIn Q3, the operator was in the tenth position.\\nWorld Marine Offshore (WMO) fell out of the top ten during this quarter.\\nThe vessel manager filed for bankruptcy in early January (see Slide 13).\\nMarket share gains and losses Key operators increase or maintain fleet utilisation CTV fleet utilisation, Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 Top 10 maintained or increased days CTV days for the top 10 operators, Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 Marginal contract gains for sector leaders Vessels on contracts, Q4 2021 v Q4 2022  More Opportunities in France and the Netherlands As offshore wind projects develop in both established and emerging markets, opportunities are increasing for smaller operators and new market entrants.\\nThis is especially seen in France where only three of the top ten were active in Q4, 2022.\\nMore than 50% of supply was from smaller local operators.\\nSome of the smaller operators, such as HST Marine, are limited by their available fleet.\\nHowever, many have growth strategies in place for their fleets, and it is expected that they will take an increasingly larger share of the smaller markets.\\nOver 25m vessels supply the winter work While a large number vessels over 25m loa were in use in the UK, substantial supply also went to Germany and France.\\nThere was a sharp fall in the days supplied by sub-20m vessels during Q4.\\nThis was down from around from over 4,000 days to a little over 2,000 days.\\nThe days supplied by >25m loa vessels fell from just under 8,000 in Q3 to just over 6,000 in Q4.\\nMajority of Supply for UK and Germany The leading European markets, the UK, Germany and Denmark, continue to be supplied by the top ten operators.\\nLong term O&M projects provide the baseline work for vessel owners.\\nOperators with larger fleets have more options when working on long term contracts.\\nFor example, if vessel maintenance work is needed, they can more readily replace CTVs with vessels of a similar capability.\\nLarger vessels remain in Germany CTV days by country and LOA for Q4 2022 France open to new operators CTV days by country and operator, Q4 2022 Top 8 operators supply UK projects CTV days by country for the leading operators, Q4, 2022  CTV Demand: Overview Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 CTV Demand Up 10% in Q4 Following a year with demand falling each quarter, Q4 showed growth with a 10% increase on Q4 2021.\\nDemand during each month of the quarter increased.\\nDespite this final rally in demand, across the year total demand decreased by 98 days, which is disappointing considering the growth in offshore wind.\\nDuring the quarter, demand increased in Germany, the Netherlands, and France.\\nThis work will continue into Q1 2023, along with additional project development in Denmark in Q2.\\nHowever, this late surge has failed to offset the reduction in demand from the UK over the year, which resulted in a net reduction in vessel days.\\nThere may be a small uplift in CTV demand in the UK during Q1 2023.\\nThis is due to the delayed arrival of Edda Brint, the SOV for the Seagreen project.\\nThe vessel will now arrive in March, so additional CTV support is likely to be needed.\\nDemand increase in Q4 brings welcome relief to operators Monthly CTV days between 2018 and 2022 Q4, 2022 demand shows recovery CTV days per quarter, 2021 v 2022 Increased demand in Europe – except UK CTV days by country, Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 Q4 Demand Fails to Make Up Shortfall Across the Year 2022 has been a year of low demand for CTV days.\\nQ1 to Q3 saw a reduction in demand and, despite the increase in Q4, the year was disappointing overall.\\nThe busiest period of the year for CTV operators is during the summer, place.\\nIn 2022, demand was lower than in 2021.\\nWhile the 10% increase in Q4 was significant, the reduction in vessels days during the six months over the summer meant the shortfall could not be made up.\\nCTV Demand: Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 – Construction vs O&M O&M Demand Essential for Top 10 O&M demand provides seven out of the top 10 operators with the majority of their work.\\nLong-term contracts provide a level of financial stability.\\nShorter contracts can be lucrative but generally mean fewer days available.\\nOffshore Windservice is the one operator that is construction focussed.\\nIts fleet consists of SWATH vessels, well-suited to further offshore sites and able to provide transfer in harsher conditions, e.g.\\nincreased wave heights.\\nThe fleet profile is key to the construction vs O&M work profile for vessel operators.\\nConstruction demand continues its YoY improvement, with another 2% increase this quarter.\\nConstruction work in the nearshore in the Netherlands and France has particularly contributed to this increase.\\nWith work in Denmark and in Germany kicking off in 2023, construction demand is likely to be maintained or continue on the upward trend in the coming months.\\nVessels over 25m loa remain the construction support vessel of choice.\\nHistoric track record of CTV days per month, 2015-Q4 2022 Larger vessels winning construction work CTV days by LOA and wind farm status, Q4 2022 O&M remains key demand for top 10 operators CTV days by operator and project status, Q4 2022 Construction demand increase offsets O&M losses CTV days by status, Q4 2021 vs Q4 2022  Corporate Catch-Up: CTV Market Leaders Windcat had 43 vessels contracted during Q4 2022, achieving a utilisation rate of 64%, from 81% in Q3.\\nTSM Windcat 54 was delivered in December and Hydrocat 55 is now on sea trials with delivery expected soon for work in Germany.\\nThe operator has

Vessel Supply: SOV & CSOV Market Shares and Updates To date, our analysis of the long-term O&M market has focused on purpose build vessels e.g.\\nSOVs.\\nHowever, larger projects further offshore have created a demand for multi-purpose vessels.\\nThis has been fulfilled by existing tonnage as well as specialist new builds.\\nThe key characteristic of the vessel supply for this work is having a Walk to Work (W2W) capability.\\nTherefore, our analysis will now include all W2W vessels to provide the market context for SOVs and CSOVs.\\nEsvagt continues to provide the majority of SOV days supplied to the market - a 39% share - representing a small increase from 36% in Q3, 2022.\\nThe operator has nine active vessels (far right).\\nThe market shares for the remaining operators stays broadly the same but REM Offshore and Norwind vessels are now included in the supply.\\nIn this update, REM Energy and Norwind Breeze are included.\\nPreviously, as converted vessels (not new build), they were excluded from the analysis.\\nDespite the additional vessels, overall numbers were static, with 24 having contracted work in the quarter.\\nIt should be noted that REM Energy was working in Q4 2021.\\nAfter a few years of rapid growth, SOV supply to the market has plateaued.\\nIn our Q4 2022 update, 4C reported that Edda Brint was expected to start work towards the end of the year.\\nDelays to the installation of the MacGregor W2W system on the vessel, and that of Edda Breeze, mean the vessel will commence contracts in March.\\nEdda Goelo is also delayed.\\nThe SOV will start work around October 2023 on the Saint Brieuc (FR) project for SGRE.\\nA further seven vessels are set to enter the market by the end of 2023.\\nOverall, days supplied the sector have increased slightly by 21.\\nThe top three operators supply 64% of the days.\\nOPERATORS: Esvagt maintains place as market leader Market share of SOV operators, Q4 2022 vessel days Esvagt fleet maintains market lead SOV days by operator with number of active SOVs Small increase in days supplied YoY Number of SOV days Q4, 2021 vs Q4, 2022 But vessel numbers remain the same Active SOVs Q4, 2021 vs Q4, 2022  W2W Vessel Supply: W2W Market Shares and Updates 1,034 W2W days were supplied to the sector in Q4 2022, a modest increase of ~8% compared to Q4 2021.\\nThese were delivered by a total of 18 vessels.\\nNew Opportunities for O&G Vessels Traditionally, the offshore wind sector has not been seen as a target market for offshore support vessels (OSVs) or platform supply vessels (PSVs).\\nTypically, they would be contracted to oil and gas projects but the downturn in the O&G market has made the offshore wind sector more attractive, especially as activity has ramped up in further offshore locations.\\nIn turn, offshore wind project developers have seen the advantage of multipurpose vessels, which could remain at sea and provide accommodation for personnel.\\nThe number of operators supplying W2W days is greater than that of SOV operators, and the market share is more evenly distributed.\\nIn Q4 2022 there were 14 W2W operators in offshore wind (below).\\nThe number of W2W vessels active in the sector is currently below the number of SOVs and CSOVs.\\nHowever, the number is increasing, with more expected.\\n4C understands that there is probably more utilisation of OSVs with and without W2W systems onboard than has perhaps been previously anticipated.\\nAll the operators are better known in the O&G sector than in offshore wind, apart from the Northern Offshore Group (N-O-G).\\nN-O-G is the parent of CTV operators N-O-S and Mareel so is well known in the offshore wind market.\\nThe company has pursued its diversification strategy in recent years, expanding into other sectors as well as now larger support vessels in offshore wind.\\nThe company has two W2W vessels, Northern Wave and Northern Ocean.\\nThe latter has carried out geotechnical survey work as well as W2W duties.\\nOPERATORS: Supply more fragmented than for SOVs Market shares of W2W operators, Q4 2022 vessel days Active W2Ws Q4, 2021 vs Q4, Number of W2W days Q4, 2021 vs Q4, Siem leads W2W supply in Q4, 2022 W2W Days by operator with number of active W2Ws Q4, 2022  Major growth in O&M demand slowing SOV days by project status Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 Only Germany shows improvement in SOV days SOV days by country, Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 SOV Demand: Q4 2021 v Q3 2022 Clients: Turbine OEMs Remain Top Clients for Demand The chart below shows that SOV support is the main maintenance strategy for turbine manufacturers, especially SGRE.\\nØrsted has had a clear policy towards SOV support on projects for some time, and is the third largest client for SOV support.\\nEquinor is also following this route (see chart below).\\nThe developer has switched to SOV support on the Dudgeon and Sheringham Shoal sites in the UK as well as booking an SOV for Empire Wind in the US.\\nSOVs have been used by other project operators, but it is the long term (5-15 year contracts) which is driving the majority of the demand.\\nSOV Demand Returning to O&M work Construction demand for SOVs fell by 43.5%, while O&M increased by 16%.\\nThis is positive, but a slow down from the 23% increase seen in Q3 2022.\\nThis could be an effect of projects with SOV support booked, moving from construction to the O&M phase.\\nHowever, it is also possible that CSOVs are being displaced by W2W vessels.\\nPotentially more interesting is an increase in the days for projects closer to O&M ports (see left).\\nProjects less than 60 km from port have had a significant increase in the use of SOV/CSOVs YoY.\\nSOVs on site on projects closer to port SOV days by distance from O&M port, Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 SOV days supplied to clients since 2015  W2W Demand: Q4 2022 v Q4 2021 Clients: Large Number of Clients for W2W Vessels Analysis (below) shows the broad range of clients who have booked W2W support.\\nIn total, almost 50 clients have worked in offshore wind since 2015.\\nSupply comes from 27 operators.\\nThe chart below highlights the top 10 clients and top 15 operators.\\nAs with the SOVs, SGRE is the leading client, followed closely by Ørsted.\\nWhile Vestas is in second place as a client for SOV support, here the turbine manufacturer is in sixth position behind project developers.\\nSGRE’s high utilisation of W2W support is a indication of the organisation’s ownership of projects (greater than Vestas), meaning it has engagement in construction and not just operations and maintenance work.\\n>50% Increase in Construction Days In Q4 2022, demand for W2W days increased by 54% compared to 2021.\\nThis suggests that multi-function capability of W2W vessels has been recognised and is becoming more attractive in offshore construction.\\nFrom almost zero days in 2021, the Netherlands and Norway provided some construction demand.\\nAll the demand in Norway was for the Hywind Tampen floating project, which is over 160 km from the O&M port.\\nIn the Netherlands, W2W vessels were in action on the Hollandse Kust Zuid Holland I and II site.\\nIn Germany and the UK, however, demand fell.\\nIn the UK, this was almost 40%, in part a reflection of projects such as Hornsea Two entering full operations, for which long-term SOV support has been booked.\\nGrowth in YoY construction demand W2W days by project status, Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 W2W days down across most of Europe W2W days by country, Q4 2021 v Q4 2022 SGRE leading client for W2W support W2W days supplied to clients since

markets, details of developer and technology providers’ activities, forecasts to 2030 and 2035.\\nAt the end of 2022, after several years of increasingly raised expectations and growing national targets for floating wind, the market is characterised by high supply-side activity – notably a large and often bloated pipeline of projects.\\nThis enthusiasm for action is not being met in the middle by the regulators who must lay the framework for progress; expediate site leasing, remove hurdles to obtaining planning consents, and provide clarity in offtake visibility.\\nDelays to date have been measured in years.\\nGiven the long lead-times of 7-10 years or more for floating projects from site award, 4C has revised down its 2030 outlook of capacity installed or underway from 16 GW to 14 GW (equivalent to 8 GW operational).\\nMaintaining this outlook will require leaders to shift their focus from the 2030-2040 time horizon to the here and now, and ensure 2023 is a year of decision making and action.\\nEmerging European countries are catching up with the more-established markets in terms of ambition and developer pipelines.\\nA total 54 GW of floating wind capacity has been committed to.\\nPortugal announced a 10 GW floating wind target by 2030 in Q3 2022, while Italy is expected to target 5 GW by 2030, and Spain 1-3 GW by 2030.\\nFrance is running multiple floating wind auctions.\\nThe UK, the world’s most established floating market, is targeting 5 GW by 2030.\\nA running theme of increased targets and auction capacities is also apparent in the US, which will begin tenders in California in December.\\nAlso in Q3, the US announced a 15 GW of floating wind by 2035 target and initiatives to reduce costs by more than 70% by 2035 to a proposed cost of $45/MWh (€44.78/MWh).\\nSouth Korea Leap-Frogs to 2030 In APAC, South Korea’s strategy of going straight to GW-scale deployment with the help of large international developers will make it the leader both in 2030 and 2035, potentially making it the first country in the world to reach double-digit GW installation of floating wind.\\nIn APAC, Japan is expected to follow with commercial projects in the 2030’s, after a slow and steady approach in the 2020’s focused on Japanese R&D and pre- commercial demonstration.\\nChina, too, is expected to scale up quickly within the next few years – a difficult market to track due to 5-year block planning by the Chinese government.\\nThe floating market today has parallels with the fixed-bottom market a decade earlier.\\nThe capacity for floating wind development is increasing globally, as governments become attuned to the benefits of floating wind v fixed-bottom wind (less visibility, fewer environmental impacts, stronger wind resource in deeper water, etc.)\\nCompetition and expectations are high, but better incentives need to be offered as routes to market remain scarce.\\nCost reduction in more established floating technology is heavily dependent on economies of scale in turbine size, project size and pipelines, with continued innovations needed to bring costs to parity with fixed-bottom.\\nThis will require heavy investment in port infrastructure to cope with mass production, assembly, and O&M.\\nCost-reduction drivers for moorings and electrical systems are being led by more efficient materials engineering, installation methods, and reduced reliance on specialist vessels.\\nThese topics and more are explored in this report.\\nThis report accompanies other components of your subscription; project databases,

in 2035 Cumulative floating wind capacity entering construction by Georegion (GW) 4C Offshore now forecasts that 14 GW of floating wind will commence installation globally by 2030, and 46 GW by 2035, which corresponds to a current estimate of 8 GW operational by 2030 and 38 GW by 2035.\\nCompared with the previous forecast in May 2022, the forecasts to 2030 and 2035 have both been reduced by about 2 GW.\\nThe decrease reflects continued policy-side delays and slow permitting in multiple countries.\\nDespite high ambitions from developers, with several companies having floating pipelines greater than 10 GW, development will slow without tangible government support and actions.\\nThe leading countries are South Korea and United States with ~10 GW each by 2035 (right, bottom).\\nEurope remains the leading georegion with 18 GW by 2035 (right, top), closely followed by APAC with 17 GW (inc. China).\\nThe forecast is contingent on effective cost reductions of floating wind and clearer government support to enable investment and reduce risk.\\nChanges in 4C’s outlook to 2030 4C’s 2030 forecast for Italy has decreased by 1.45 GW (left, bottom) since Q2 2022 due to continued delays in the issuance of the FER 2 decree and auctions needing to be pushed back as a result.\\nMeanwhile, China’s forecast to 2030 increased by 1 GW due to visibility on a GW-scale project to be deployed in Wanning, Hainan Province by the end of the decade.\\nChanges in 4C’s outlook to 2035 Taiwan contributed the largest decrease, with 3 GW, due to lack of government-approved deep-water sites suitable for floating wind combined with a lack of port space and infrastructure to support large growth in floating wind.\\nSouth Korea and United States to lead floating wind in 2035 Cumulative floating wind capacity entering construction by country (GW) Italy contributes the largest decrease in 2030 forecast Changes in the 2030 forecast between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022 Taiwan contributes largest decrease in 2035 forecast Changes in the 2035 forecast between Q2 2022 and Q4 2022  Up to 50 GW by Targets: The UK has set a net-zero emissions goal for 2050.\\nThe 2030 offshore wind target was raised to 50 GW in 2022, of which 5 GW will be floating.\\nForecast: 4C has assumed that CfDs for floating will be including in AR5 (March 2023) and beyond, and that business models for INTOG are financeable.\\nEarly projects through both these routes are assumed to be of ‘stepping-stone’ scale.\\nFour demos totalling 115 MW assumed to be underway by 2030 include TwinHub, Blyth, Pentland (single turbine) and Dolphyn.\\nFive small grid-connected stepping-stones totalling 485 MW and three INTOG projects totalling 880 MW are also expected to hit the water by end-2030.\\nFrom 2031 the first Celtic Sea and ScotWind floaters are expected.\\nTargets: France is targeting net-zero by 2050 and 32% renewable energy generation by 2030.\\nUnder the 2030 Investment Plan, Macron announced 40 GW of operational offshore wind by 2050, which means fixed/floating offshore wind will need to be built at a rate of approximately 1.5 GW/Year between 2035 and 2050.\\nThe 2022 Sector Deal will increase annual offshore wind tenders from 1 to 2 GW from 2025.\\nForecast: Four pilot-scale projects are due to be operational between 2023-25.\\nThe first commercial-scale floating tender for 250 MW was launched off Brittany in 2021.\\nTwo 250 MW tenders in the Mediterranean have been launched, with

2023, beginning with fixed-bottom wind.\\nA 1.5 GW area designated for floating wind in the Utsira Nord region is expected to be allocated by end-2023.\\nForecast: Demand for floating wind is driven by O&G electrification projects.\\nHywind Tampen will conclude the installation of four remaining turbines (out of 11) in spring 2023.\\nDue to auction delays, 4C now estimates 600 MW of floating wind to be underway by 2030, with an additional 2 GW by 2035.\\nTargets: Spain’s Roadmap for the Development of Offshore Wind and Sea Energies, approved in December 2021, sets forth a target of 1-3 GW offshore wind by 2030.\\nIn 2023, the government aims to finalize Marine Spatial Plans for offshore wind and update the regulatory framework, setting the scene for the first offshore wind tender.\\nAt a local level, the Government of the Canary Islands is targeting 2.4 GW by 2040, as of April 2022.\\nForecast: Spain aims to be an R&D centre for the demonstration of new floating wind technologies, with test centres like PLOCAN and BIMEP and projects like PivotBuoy and Demosath.\\nThe country also has a strong supply chain forming and excellent manufacturing capabilities.\\n4C is estimating a slightly reduced forecast of 1.3 GW by 2030 (compared with last report’s 2.3 GW forecast) due to policy-side delays.\\nHowever, 4C still expects Spain to become a leader in floating wind in terms of capacity in the next decade, with 2.3 GW by 2035.\\nTargets: According to its National Energy & Climate Plan, Ireland aims to develop 5 GW of offshore wind by 2030.\\nSeveral major developers have announced GW-scale projects for operation in the 2030’s, with Hexicon, Iberdrola, and Simply Blue Energy each having a floating wind pipeline in Ireland equal to or exceeding 2 GW.\\nIreland may want to adopt offshore wind auctions, so a clear roadmap needs to be set up.\\nForecast: 4C anticipates that the Emerald Demo (300 MW) will begin construction by 2030 and 1.7 GW of projects in the pipeline to enter construction by 2035.\\nThis may change in the future once there is more clarity in the market.\\n1 Unless specified, ambition is not broken down into fixed v floating 2 Volume installed or foundation installation underway  [draft] Targets: Italy published another draft of the FER 2 decree in July 2022, outlining incentives for renewable energy production, with 5 GW designated for floating wind by 2030.\\nThe auctions planned to take place between 2022-2026, with operations by 2030, will be pushed back given policy-side delays.\\nIt is currently unclear if auctions will be able to take place between 2023-2027.\\nForecast: Italy is aiming to reduce lengthy authorization procedures with the implementation of one-stop authorization and Marine Spatial Plans (MSP).\\nThere is a huge amount of developer interest, with multi-GW projects announced by major companies.\\nHowever, the lack of a finalized FER 2 decree (now 3 years late) and no government level-MSP for offshore wind will prevent deployment, potentially for years to come.\\nTargets: As of June 2022, Portugal is targeting 10 GW by 2030.\\nPreviously, Portugal was targeting 3-4 GW by 2026.\\nForecast: Portugal currently has 25 MW of floating wind operational.\\nThere has been little developer interest since WindFloat Atlantic (WFA), but commercial scale projects may emerge with the newly announced

July 2022, the Parliament passed the first offshore wind bill.\\nAdditionally, Greece is targeting 2 GW of offshore wind by 2030, assumed to be entirely floating.\\nForecast: There has been considerable developer interest in the region (e.g.\\nOcean Winds, Equinor, and RWE), but given the lack of offshore wind experience and auctions due to start in 2025/26 at the earliest, the market is not very mature.\\n4C estimates 750 MW as feasible by 2035, with 250 MW underway by 2030.\\nTargets: Floating wind in the United States will be essential to achieve President Biden’s 30 GW by 2030

December 2021 in Guangdong Province.\\nThe floating market currently lacks long-term goals, in part due to the nature of China’s Five-Year Plans.\\nHowever, 4C expects China could become one of the top 5 countries in terms of floating wind capacity, with at least 3 GW entering construction by 2035.\\nTargets: Japan has set an offshore wind tendering target of 10 GW by 2030 (~1GW tendered /year).\\nCommercial-scale floating wind is not expected in Japan before the 2030’s, with the 2020’s being an important decade for Japan to build their own floating wind industry from the ground

from those commissioned through to the recent ScotWind clearing.\\nThis ‘site-secured’ pipeline can grow or shrink 1.\\nAccretion: Sites are growing in capacity.\\nSites are being consented without an upper generating limit, allowing them to capture increases in turbine rating.\\nSeveral GW have been added via accretion since the Round 2 extension leasing.\\n2.\\nAttrition: Conversely, sites can shrink or be refused consent.\\nSimilarly, developers may abandon sites.\\nHistorical attrition rates are around 30% depending on the level of risk reduction prior to leasing, which has increased.\\n3.\\nLeasing in process: INTOG leasing (6.2 GW) is underway and Celtic Sea (4 GW) is scheduled for mid-2023.\\nThis will take the total ‘site-secured’ pipeline to ~90 GW (fixed 59 GW,

Offshore Wind Policy (2020) refers to ScotWind 2.\\nSeveral GW of projects are also trying to pursue site leases on a bilateral basis.\\nTaking 100 GW as the average of the CCC & BEIS mid-case scenarios, an additional 10 GW could be required beyond the ‘site-secured’ pipeline (excluding changes due to attrition and accretion).\\nAny further leasing would create a surplus of sites.\\nIn the

80 MW capacity, but this has increased to 1.2 GW.\\nHas not yet applied for a Foreshore licence to carry out any site investigation work on this project.\\nPlans to submit MAC in 2023 and be operational by 2030.\\nPlans to submit MAC in 2023 and start construction in 2028.\\nOriginally, the Emerald projects were to be developed in three phases, but now reduced to two.\\nDevelopers are targeting a 2029 start to the 300 MW first phase.\\nPhase two is scheduled for 2037.\\nCapacity is likely to be less than the 1,000 MW in current licence applications.\\nLir Offshore Array applied for a Foreshore Licence in 2021 to carry out site investigations.\\nApplied for a Foreshore Licence and started public consultation on the first phase of the project, which lies within the 12nm boundary.\\nProposing ODE’s innovative Articulated Water Column (AWC) design, requiring a single mooring.\\nPart of a 4GW H2 production facility Schedule published by the developer suggests the project will be online and exporting electricity by 2030.\\nBut due to regulatory delays, 4C expects a much later start.\\nHexicon has partnered with Killybegs for a 2 GW development 50 km offshore Donegal.\\nLarge potential for floating projects While there are shallow-water, nearer-shore sites to the east of the country, the Irish west and southwestern coast lends itself to floating wind.\\nThe government has committed to develop a long-term plan, setting out how Ireland will develop at least 30 GW of floating wind.\\nThere is already over 14 GW of floating capacity in development, outlined in the table (below).\\nDespite this large pipeline, floating wind will unlikely be in Irish waters before 2030, once all fixed-bottom sites are exhausted.\\nFloating wind projects in Ireland Norway is set to hold its first offshore wind auction in 2023 (pushed back from 2022), for 1.5 GW of bottom- fixed wind in Sørlige Nordsjø II.\\nThe government will set aside NOK 80m (€ 7.7m) for offshore wind in 2023, which will go towards investigations of the 3 GW Sørlige Nordsjø II site.\\nA further NOK 25m will go towards environmental impact assessments of new sites, not yet identified.\\nThe government is also set to allocate 1.5 GW of FOW in the Utsira Nord area.\\nAward will be according to “qualitative criteria” in order to facilitate innovation, technology development and cost reduction.\\nApplications will be filed in Q1 2023, with lease awards by Q4 2023.\\nThe well-established oil and gas sector in Norway creates a pathway for FOW, in terms of both infrastructure and O&G electrification.\\nHywind Tampen will be the first multi-turbine FOW project to power an O&G platform, following on from the pioneering 5MW Beatrice Demo in Scotland (generating until 2016).\\nElectricity will be supplied first to Gullfaks, then to the Snorre field.\\nThe first seven Hywind Tampen turbines will start operating this year.\\nHowever, assembly of the final four turbines was delayed to October, due to supply chain bottlenecks, most notably related to the global market for steel.\\nOctober was too late in relation to the installation weather window for the year, hence Equinor postponed installation of the remaining four turbines to spring 2023.\\nClarity on timelines and state support mechanisms for the Utsira Nord floating site is needed for commercialisation of FOW in Norway.\\nMap of Irish floating projects  France: Auctions at a Glance France is targeting 32% renewable energy by 2030 and net zero by 2050.\\nFrance heavily relies on nuclear energy (75% of total production), but outages in the past year have highlighted need for other forms of energy production.\\nFrance aims to position itself as a floating wind leader with technical potential of 33 GW.\\nTo date, the 2 MW Floatgen demo has been operational at SEM-REV (off Le Croisic) since 2018.\\nA further ~100 MW across four floating pilots is due to be operational between 2023 and 2025 (chart, below).\\nUnder the current Multiannual Energy Program (PPE), the first commercial scale tenders have been launched for: 1 x 250 MW floating project offshore Brittany (map, right) 2 x 250 MW floating projects in the Mediterranean Areas have also been identified for subsequent 500 MW extensions to each site, tendered after 2024.\\nThe 2022 Sector Deal will increase annual tenders from 1 to 2 GW from 2025 (fixed or floating); allocate 20 GW by 2030; have 18 GW operational by 2035 (Q2 2022 Market Overview).\\nA new Energy and Climate strategy, including updated PPE, will confirm the next tender schedule in 2023/24.\\nTo meet 2035 goals, the next PPE must identify an extra 10 GW of OFW tenders by 2035.\\nInstallation rate should be at least 1.5 GW/year between 2035 and 2050.\\nMaintaining momentum and stable growth is key to reducing risk to developers and the supply chain, particularly following the delays experienced by early round projects (due to lengthy appeals).\\nFirst commercial floating tenders: South of Brittany As the first 250 MW floating tender draws to a close, the final tender area, located 20 km from Pointe des Poulains de Belle-Île, was finalized this autumn, via the competitive dialogue tender phase with the 10 pre- qualified bidders (map, Q3 2021 Market Overview).\\nContinued on Next Three floats under construction in Eiffage Métal's Fos- sur-Mer site.\\nThe first transition piece has been installed.\\nMaersk contracted to install the turbines with offshore operations scheduled to take place in Q4 2023. with Ademe.\\nCommissioning is now expected to be 2025.\\nFID May 2022.\\nCommissioning 2024.\\nCandidates must submit their offers in early 2023.\\nThe winner will be designated by the government in the spring.\\nCommissioning in 2030.\\nThe competitive dialogue period will end in Q4 2022.\\nThe winner(s) will be selected in Autumn 2023.\\nRegulatory amendments have helped streamline procedures over recent years, e.g.\\nearly public participation, bundled authorisations, a flexible ‘license envelope’, single-level jurisdiction to handle appeals, and a reformed tender mechanism (2021 Floating Report).\\nHowever, long project timelines (approx.\\n10 years) and local opposition is still prevalent.\\nThis autumn the Minister for Energy Transition presented a bill to the Senate for ‘the acceleration of the production of renewable energies’, with the aim to reconcile public acceptability.\\nIt includes measures to speed up authorization, which currently stand at twice as long as other European neighbours, in effort to ensure targets area met.\\nPolicies include, simplifying the procedures under local planning and environment code and setting a maximum examination target of 24 months, and 2.5 years for litigation.\\nThe bill also aims to simplify grid connection agreements and pool procedures for marine spatial planning and public participation for offshore wind so, only one single debate is held process is held.\\nIt also clarifies the regime applicable to offshore wind farms which straddle the public domain and EEZ.\\nProjects will only need to follow the approval procedures of the public domain.\\nFrance: Get set for Mediterranean Tenders In the Public Domain (…Continued) The future project will be located in the eastern part of the original tender call area, solely within the public domain, not the EEZ.\\nThe public domain requires separate consents for rights to occupy the site and environmental consents, whereas this is bundled for projects in the EEZ.\\nThis could result in more opportunities for appeals and slower consent processing.\\nSeveral local elected officials and associations have expressed disappointment that the project was not located further from shore in the EEZ.\\nTaxation and fees have been clarified for the public domain vs the EEZ this year (Q2 2022 Market Overview).\\nThe winning developer will be liable for over ~ €4 m/year in taxes and over ~ €1 m/year in royalty fees.\\nThe final specifications of the call for tenders will be submitted for the opinion of the Energy Regulatory Commission in the coming weeks.\\nPreselected candidates will submit offers in early 2023 and a winner(s) will be designated next spring, with commissioning anticipated in 2030-31.\\nFinal bids will be evaluated based on three main criteria, with the precise details hashed out during the competitive dialogue: (1) the economic and financial value of the offer, (2) social and territorial development issues, and (3) environmental issues.\\nCandidates will reportedly be encouraged to minimize the final footprint as part of the new scoring criteria, with higher ranking given to projects located just within the centre of the area (map, previous slide).\\n2x 250 MW Mediterranean Tenders The government pre-selected 13 candidates to participate in the competitive dialogue and submit final bids for two 230-280 MW floating tenders this summer (table, Q3 & Q2 2022 Market Overviews).\\nThe competitive dialogue period will close end-2022.\\nWinner(s) will be selected in autumn 2023.\\nThe first site is located off the Narbonnaise in the EEZ (Zone 1, map).\\nThe preferred location of the second site is off the Gulf of Fosin in the EEZ (Zone 2, map), subject to the results of ongoing environmental studies.\\nIf necessary, the second site may be relocated off Roussillon (Zone 3).\\nAreas are to be refined to around 50 km2 per project.\\nThe remaining area will be put forward for two extensions of 500 MW of 100 km2 each, with location to be finalized around spring 2023.\\nThe shortlist of bidders for both tenders (table) features the usual suspects which already hold shares in French offshore wind projects e.g.\\nEDF, Ocean Winds, Iberdrola, and Maple Power (Enbridge CPPB), and those participating in the French floating demos.\\nClear partnerships appear to be forming across both tenders.\\nWhereas companies like Equinor have developed own technology (e.g.\\nHywind), some will rely on forming partnerships with floating foundation suppliers.\\nThe Eoliennes Flottantes Bretagne Grand Large consortium (EDF and Maple Power) has signed an agreement with BW Ideol to cooperate on a technical solution for floating foundations.\\nThe Sector Deal, targets 50% local content across project costs, at the time of commissioning, by 2035.\\nBut this is not legally binding as this could lead to higher costs and slow investment, as seen for Round 1&2 projects which required some degree of French turbine manufacturing.\\nFrance has engineering and production capacities positioned across the entire value chain, e.g.\\nthe Eiffage Métal shipyard in Fos-sur-Mer will build the floaters for the Provence Grand Large project, and new plants in Saint Nazaire, Cherbourg and Le Havre will supply turbine components for the first rounds of fixed offshore projects.\\nMultiple ports are adapting for floating wind.\\nThe Occitanie region is investing €340 million to refurbish ports in Sète and Port-la-Nouvelle to support floating wind including, a 250 m platform support the heavy cranes needed to assemble floaters, additional terminals for turbine assembly and deepening of the basin.\\nThe Port of Brest has been expanded with a new 40-hectare quay.\\nDAMEN Shipyards Group has developed an 80m x 420m dry dock which can serve as an assembly point for floaters in Brittany Port of Marseille Fos has been extended to support Mediterranean projects.\\nShortlist of bidders for both tenders  Spain: New framework, auctions and MSPs in 2023 Despite a lack of visibility on marine spatial plans (MSP), project permitting procedures, auction timelines, and grid coordination, Spain has received significant interest from developers and has begun to establish a strong supply chain for floating offshore wind.\\nRoadmap targets 3 GW by 2030 In December 2021, the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge approved the Roadmap for the Development of Offshore Wind and Sea Energies, targeting up to 3 GW of FOW by 2030.\\nThe roadmap contains a timeline of commitments to Europe for the period 2021-2023.\\nBy 2023, authorities will have: Approved the final Marine Space Management Plans (POEMs) Improved network planning and marine strategy coordination The government is currently processing the POEMs, expected to be approved by the end of 2022.\\nSubsequently, the new regulatory framework is set to be published in 2023.\\nThe objective of the framework is to coordinate the permitting for installation, sea access, and grid access and installation, while promoting investment through competitive bidding procedures.\\nDevelopers are anticipating the first offshore wind auction in 2023, in the Canary Islands.\\nSpain aims to be an R&D centre for demonstrating new floating wind technologies.\\nAt least €200 m in public funds will be available until 2023 for R&D within the framework of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (PRTR).\\nPlataforma Oceanica de Canarias (PLOCAN) and Biscay Marine Energy Park (BIMEP) are the two main test centres in Spain.\\nX1 Wind’s Pivotbuoy was recently installed at PLOCAN and Saitec’s Demosath will be installed at BIMEP in the coming months.\\nIn the PRTR, port infrastructure will receive investments of up to €1bn.\\nThe existing wind turbine manufacturing supply chain and available ports gives Spain a competitive advantage.\\nSpain hosted Windfloat Atlantic’s turbine installation and foundation manufacture - turbines were installed at the Port of Ferrol and one platform was manufactured at the Avilés and Ferrol shipyards.\\nManufacture of the Bluesath floater was also performed in Spain at Degimas factory in Cantabria.\\nThe Ferrol Port Authority approved the construction of Nervio Naval Offshore’s proposed assembly plant for floaters.\\nThe facility in the port’s Caneliñas dock will occupy 70,000m2.\\nSpain has a large pipeline of floating wind projects, expected to be operational throughout the decade.\\nThe below chart shows the ten developers with the largest pipeline in Spain.\\nVinci is at the top, having recently submitted environmental documents to MITECO for six projects, under subsidiary Cobra.\\nDevelopers are competing to deploy the first floating project in Spanish waters.\\nBluefloat and Capital Energy’s 50 MW project, Granadilla, has already secured seabed rights.\\nDue to the simpler laws regarding maritime energy at ports, permitting should be quicker than for projects further offshore.\\nSaitec’s 45 MW Geroa may be the first offshore wind farm in Spain, with operations in 2025.\\nSaitec has the advantage of already successfully trialling their Sath barge.\\nPortugal: Huge targets but no visibility In June 2022, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Environment and Energy Transition set a 10 GW offshore wind target by 2030.\\nThe government is currently assessing the feasibility of this, and has established three controlling variables: (i) marine space, (ii) port infrastructure, and (iii) grid connection.\\nOnly 25 MW of floating wind is operational in Portugal, so to reach the 10 GW target, a further 665 turbines will need to be installed over the next 7 years (assuming turbine capacity of 15 MW).\\nSuitable areas of seabed need to be identified through Marine Spatial Plans (a date for these is yet to be confirmed).\\nA dedicated zone for renewable energy off the coast of Viana do Castelo has been identified (map below).\\nThis lies just above Windfloat Atlantic.\\nBaywa r.e.’s 600 MW subsidy free project, will be built in this zone, consisting of 30 x 20 MW turbines.\\nThe project is undergoing authorisation procedures, and has applied for site exclusivity.\\nMarine Power Systems (MPS) and WavEC have also announced plans to test test site offshore Viana do Castelo.\\nIberian Peninsula: Spain and Portugal Spain: Top 10 floating developers Portugal: dedicated zone for renewable energy  Italy: Long road to FER 2 finalisation With most of Italy’s offshore wind potential in very deep waters, floating wind is expected to dominate the market once commercial scale projects begin to take off in the mid-to-late 2020’s.\\nDespite several developers announcing multi-GW ambitions for floating wind in Italy (see below), the country continues to be held back by administrative hurdles.\\nCompanies like BlueFloat and Hexicon both have more than 5 GW of floating wind projects proposed off the coast of Italy.\\nItaly’s long-awaited FER 2 decree, which will outline incentives for renewable energy production, has not yet been finalized.\\nThe decree is more than 3 years late, facing multiple delays due in part to COVID-19.\\nThe July 2022 draft of the decree raised Italy’s floating wind target from 3.5 to 5 GW by 2030 and increased the incentive period from 20 to 25 years, with an expected offtake price of €165/MWh.\\nThe decree includes all renewables excluded from the preceding FER 1, such as geothermal, offshore wind, biomass, biogas, and solar thermal.\\nAuctions for offshore wind are expected to support floating wind only, with fixed-bottom wind facing much greater opposition due to ‘visual pollution’, potential conflicts for the tourism industry, and environmental concerns.\\nOriginally, the first offshore wind auctions were planned for 2022-2026 (with operation by 2030 for the awarded projects), but this will be delayed until the finalization of the FER 2 decree, possible in 2023.\\nIf auctions are held from 2023-2027 and Italy’s target is 5 GW by 2030, 1 GW per year is expected to be awarded via auction.\\nLengthy bureaucratic processes have hindered offshore wind in the region for many years, and, without change, will continue to do so, making it challenging for the country to reach a suggested target of 5 GW of floating wind by 2030.\\nThe FER 2 decree promises to simplify authorization processes in Italy, but its continued delay instead complicates development, increases uncertainty and distrust in government processes, and prevents investment.\\n160 x 11 MW, floater unspecified Previously stated as a fixed-bottom project.\\nHowever, as of November 2022, Agnes is evaluating alternative foundation types.\\nIT95 Sicily – GreenIT and CIP IT96 Sardinia – GreenIT and CIP 80 x 15 MW, steel semi-sub expected 90 x 15 MW, steel semi-sub 45 x 15 MW, steel semi-sub expected 53 x 15 MW, steel semi-sub expected 40 x 15 MW, steel semi-sub expected In July, Greece approved its first offshore wind framework, after years of deliberation.\\nThe country is targeting a minimum of 2 GW of offshore (floating) wind by 2030.\\nPreviously, Greece’s National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) set forth a target of 7 GW combined onshore and offshore wind by 2030.\\nThe NECP is due for revision in 2023, making it likely the target will be raised.\\nThe country currently has 4.5 GW of installed onshore wind, meaning the 7 GW wind target by 2030 may be surpassed by onshore wind alone.\\nIn 2023, decrees will be issued, and the Ministry for Environment and Energy will begin commissioning Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) to define development zones for floating wind.\\nAll major local stakeholders (communities, the military, fisheries, tourism industry, and shipping industry) will be consulted during the drafting of specific guidelines and criteria for the future auctions.\\nIn 2024, developers are expected to be able to apply for non-exclusive research permits for the development zones to begin feasibility studies, impact assessments, and early site surveys.\\nThese research permits will be a prerequisite for future participation in auctions.\\nGreece will run the first offshore wind tenders in the mid-2020’s, as early as 2025/26.\\nAmong developers that have expressed interest, RWE has partnered with HELPE Renewables to explore offshore wind in Greece.\\nGiven the nascency of the market, with 0 MW of offshore wind installed, and the regulatory framework currently being designed, 4C envisions ~250 MW of offshore wind starting installation by 2030.\\nThe forecast will gradually increase once analyst confidence in Greece’s prospects grows, and the authorization process takes shape.\\nresearch permits.\\ninvestigation.\\nMajor Italian Projects and Developers  Denmark: First Danish Floating Proposals via Open Door Scheme The Danish Energy Agency (DEA) has recently received an unprecedented number of feasibility permit applications for offshore wind projects via the Open-Door scheme (Q3 2022 Market Overview) including, the would- be first Danish floating demo and commercial-scale projects.\\nAlthough relatively shallow water, Danish energy and distribution company Andel will investigate the testing of floating foundations if sediment is deemed too soft for monopiles and jackets at a site south of Anholt, if granted a feasibility permit.\\nWith experience as owners of the Rødsand 2 offshore wind farm and prospective bidders for Danish the energy islands, Andel intends to form a consortium with an experienced partner for the project.\\nBornholm Bassin Øst & Syd CIP and Ørsted have applied for permits for two 1.5 GW sites off Bornholm.\\nBased on water depths and geological examination, it is possible to use jackets and semi-sub TLPs and buoyant guided monopiles.\\nConnection via the Bornholm Energy Island is being considered.\\nCIP has applied for the 1100 MW Bøchers Banke site.\\nMultiple foundation types will be used due to variable seabed.\\nMonopiles are expected in the northern and southern parts of the area, while jackets (piled and suction bucket) and floating structures may be used in the central area.\\nCIP are investigating possibility to connect to Fjord PtX project which CIP is developing with Reno Nord and Aalborg Forsyning North Jutland Works.\\nAfter consultation, the Minister for Climate, Energy, and Supply will authorise or reject feasibility permits, which grants developers site exclusivity to carry out feasibility studies, prior to applying for an establishment permit.\\nLarge scale open door floating projects this side of 2030 in Denmark are tentative given slow processing times for open door applications by the DEA and no subsidy support.\\nWhere sites are investigating fixed or floating options, it is still anticipated that fixed will be the preferential choice, if feasible, given technology maturity and cost.\\nDenmark generally has relatively shallow seas (<50m), but competition for sites and varying seabed conditions could drive interest in floating where seabed conditions are difficult.\\nThe government recently re-located its future fixed Hesselø tender due to soft sediments.\\nUnder the June 2022 Climate Agreement, funds previously set aside for future technology neutral auctions are to be re-prioritized for other initiatives, given recent cost trends for renewables.\\nFuture Open Door projects will be solely on market terms, e.g.\\nCPPAs.\\nHowever, Kr100 m (€13.45 m) is pooled for testing offshore wind turbines from 2024.\\nUnder the Climate Agreement, the government also committed to analyse the permitting procedure with the aim of removing barriers and reducing case processing time for government tendered and Open Door projects, as well as repowering and life extensions.\\nKr8 m (€1.1 m) is set aside for 2022-2024 for the initiative (Q3 2022 Market Overview).\\n1x vertical rotor axis 11 KW turbine.\\n19 x 15 MW turbines Piled jackets, Semi-submersible tension leg platforms and buoyant guided monopiles

to weigh 45 tons with total height of 15.5 m. Blades are of steel.\\nThe production of the turbine will be stored in batteries in the body of the turbine and power will be produced off grid i.e.\\nno export cables.\\nThe ultimate aim is to produce hydrogen.\\nH2mill ApS, a private limited company, has applied for 2.5 year test period from Q4 2022 until end-Q1 2025.\\nBut this optimistic schedule is already delayed due to the slower case processing of open door projects.\\nUS: ‘Floating Wind Shot’ Targets 15 GW floating in 13 Years The US has set its first specific floating wind goal in the form of the ‘Floating Wind Shot’ (FWS) announced in September.\\nThe US is targeting 15 GW of floating wind installed by 2035.\\nThe FWS falls within existing federal goals for offshore wind: 30 GW by 2030 and 110 GW by 2050 (fixed and floating).\\nIt is an ambitious aim for a country that currently has no installed or permitted floating wind, and only 42 MW of fixed offshore wind installed.\\nThe FWS includes a related aim to drive down floating wind costs by more than 70% to $45/MWh (€46/MWh) by 2035, according to the Department of Energy (DOE).\\nThis is to be achieved via R&D funding that will help establish a local supply chain and increases in rated turbine capacities.\\nBacking up the FWS is just under $50m (€51m) of new funding, mostly under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes: $31m (€32m) for ATLANTIS II, from DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E).\\nThis second phase of the ‘Aerodynamic Turbines, Lighter and Afloat, with Nautical Technologies and Integrated Servo-control’ (ATLANTIS) programme seeks to advance innovative engineering and experimental testing for floating wind systems.\\n$3m (€3m) for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) ‘Floating Offshore Wind Array Design’ project, to develop modelling tools that will optimize floating wind farm design.\\n$6.85m (€7m) for DOE’s American-Made Floating Offshore Wind Readiness (FLOWIN) Prize competition to solicit optimized floating platform technologies.\\n~$1m (~€1m) for DOE’s West Coast Ports Analysis, which aims to outline a network of suitable ports and required updates, and its West Coast Transmission Analysis, to identify research gaps relating to Oregon, Washington, and California transmission studies.\\nFive awards, totalling $3.5m (EUR), from the National Offshore Wind R&D Consortium to projects facilitating coexistence with marine mammals and fishing and supporting offshore wind transmission for fixed and floating wind farms.\\nA $1.6m (€1.6m) Environmental Research Award from DOE and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to a project supporting the coexistence of floating wind and bats.\\n4C Offshore currently forecasts 10 GW of floating wind by 2035 in the states of Maine, Louisiana, California, and Oregon.\\nHowever, state-wide targets far exceed this.\\nOregon is proposing 3 GW by 2030, Louisiana is aiming for 5 GW by 2035, and California has targeted 25 GW by 2045.\\nTo achieve these ambitious targets, four hurdles must be overcome: 1.\\nSupply chain – offshore wind is completely novel to deep-water states, although many, especially around the Gulf of Mexico, have existing oil and gas infrastructure and expertise that can be leveraged.\\n2.\\nPorts and grid access need to be further studied, and investments need to be made into improvements.\\nThere is progress on both fronts in California, where leasing is focussed first on the south and central coasts where grid connection is easier, but solutions to identified issues are unresolved.\\n3.\\nLeasing – BOEM has planned for significant offshore wind leasing in deep waters that are suitable for floating installations (see map and next section).\\nHowever, it is unclear if these – or indeed lease execution – will be delayed due to a requirement in the Inflation Reduction Act for oil leasing ahead of offshore wind leasing.\\nA high build-out depends on the areas being leased in good time, since there are currently no floating wind leases in the US.\\n4.\\nOfftake – States and local utilities need to develop clear offtake regimes and to schedule procurements to meet their goals, as can be seen in east coast states such as New York and New Jersey.\\nDespite delays, BOEM expects to hold the first offshore wind lease in California on 6th December 2022.\\nOn offer are five lease areas: two off Humboldt along California’s central coast (totalling 1.6 GW) and three off Morro Bay along its southern coast (totalling 3 GW).\\nThe auction will follow a multiple-factor format, combining monetary bids and up to two non-monetary factors.\\nBidding credits may be based on commitments to workforce training/development.\\nAccording to the Final Sale Notice, published in October, 43 entities have qualified to bid, up from 23 in the earlier Proposed Sale Notice (table on next slide).\\nThese include partnerships with established project plans such as Castle Wind (Trident Winds/TotalEnergies) and Redwood (RCEA, Principle Power, Ocean Winds, and Aker Offshore Wind), and other local and international players.\\nAdditionally, several companies including Ørsted, TotalEnergies, Cierco, and EDP Renewables have also qualified to bid on a standalone basis as well as in consortia.\\nFirst Deep-Water Lease Auction in December 2022  US: First Deep-Water Lease Auction in December 2022 In October, BOEM completed an environmental review of the Morro Bay wind energy area; the review of Humboldt Bay was completed in May and the next step is the Final Sale Notice, which will confirm auction details and parties qualified to bid.\\nCalifornia has confirmed ambitious floating wind targets of 2-5 GW by 2030 and 25 GW by 2045.\\nThese are the largest and longest-term of any US state.\\nIt follows pressure from industry and politicians to increase the already high draft goals of 3 GW by 2030 and 15-20 GW by 2050 to hit carbon neutrality by 2045; in July, the Governor personally urged a 20 GW by 2045 target.\\nMeanwhile, California’s State Lands Commission is still considering two proposed pilot projects near the Vandenberg Space Base.\\nThis could be built much quicker than a commercial project and may well provide the first American floating wind.\\nAfter California, auctions are expected in the Gulf of Mexico, although despite floating potential in the gulf, areas finalized in October are suitable only for bottom-fixed.\\nWithin the gulf, Louisiana is pursuing a state-backed 600 MW floating wind pilot by the mid-2020s.\\nThe next floating auction will be in Oregon (map, previous slide) in 2023.\\nThese are deep-water areas, making clear that floating wind is going to be a sizeable part of the US portfolio into the 2030s.\\nFor the Central Atlantic auction, off Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, there are currently six large Call Areas.\\nThe auction is expected in 2023-4 and will mostly concern sites suitable for bottom- fixed offshore wind.\\nHowever, there is some scope for floating wind, which may or may not survive the process of narrowing down Call Areas to leases for auction.\\nWind Energy Areas (WEAs), from which lease areas will be selected, have not yet been announced, but three developers have nominated parts of broader Call Areas.\\nAvangrid and Ocean Winds have expressed interest in developing floating wind in the Central Atlantic (top right).\\nHowever, it is far from guaranteed that deeper waters will be included in the auction round.\\nGiven that the shallower waters seem more competitive, BOEM may choose to limit the choice and therefore the risk.\\nThe Gulf of Maine lease sale, expected in 2024 or later, will attract floating wind developers to the east coast.\\nBOEM is processing, separately, an application from the University of Maine to develop a floating pilot in the Gulf.\\nIt is currently determining whether there is competitive interest.\\nImage of Central Atlantic Call Areas, with areas nominated by one developer in green, those nominated by two in yellow, and those by three in red.\\nThe darker waters are deeper, and suited to floating wind.\\nOnly one area in deep water (the yellow one) was nominated by Ocean Winds.\\nThe others (the green ones in Call Areas E and F) were nominated by Avangrid.\\nMainstream also nominated areas but only in Call Areas A-D, the four that are closer to shore, which would be suitable for bottom-fixed offshore wind.\\nSource of image: BOEM.\\nThe Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) selects sites for offshore wind development.\\nTo date, 24 sites have been announced (table below).\\nSites are awarded through competitive auction bundled with an offtake agreement (previously a feed-in-tariff, now moving towards feed-in- premium).\\nJapan’s first tender was for a 16.8 MW floating wind farm, awarded in 2021 with construction now underway (end-2022).\\nSeveral of the proposed auction sites have the potential for floating wind, with developers submitting EIAs covering both fixed and floating foundation types, extending to project areas with water depths up to 200 m. However, all sites, apart from Kuji in Iwate Prefecture, have at one point been stated as a fixed-bottom site by the government.\\nA site may pass through 3 designations before it is opened to tender.\\nPrefectures provide information for potential auction sites, a process that may take several years from site selection to auction award.\\n1.\\nPreparatory: The first designation (preparatory) is for sites that have undergone preliminary surveys and feasibility reviews.\\n2.\\nPromising: In the second stage (promising designation), wind and geological surveys are conducted, a council for local coordination is formed, and grid capacity is allocated.\\n3.\\nPromotion: Once a site reaches the final stage (promotion), it has undergone all the necessary procedures to open to auction, at which point an auction may begin in the next few months.\\nJapan is currently in Round 2 and has recently finished redesigning their auction system after a half-year pause.\\nAuctions for four fixed-bottom sites are expected to begin in December 2022.\\nThe acceleration of fixed- bottom installation may pave the way for large-scale floating wind deployment in the next decade.\\nDIST.\\n(KM) DEPTH (M) INSTALLATION YEAR Nyuzen Town and Asahi Town Potential for both: fixed foundations in < 50 m deep water, floating in < 200 m.  Japan has an ample wind resource (7 m/s average) and a steep continental shelf, making floating wind the most suitable option.\\nAccording to New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan’s total utilisable sea area for offshore wind deployment is 119,000 km2 – in waters up to 200m deep and at a maximum of 30 km offshore.\\nThe potential for fixed wind is 21,000 km2, while the suitable potential area for floating wind is 98,000 km2.\\nIt is estimated that Japan has an offshore wind potential of ~600 GW.\\nAssuming fixed-bottom wind accounts for 15-20% of that potential, floating wind could account for roughly 500 GW of Japan’s potential.\\nThe 2020’s will be a critical decade for floating wind innovation, development, and demonstration in Japan, before commercialization and large-scale expansion can take place in the 2030’s and beyond.\\nThe nation is taking a more gradual, lower-risk approach to floating wind deployment, deciding to focus on building the Japanese supply chain and Japanese technology for floating solutions from the ground up rather than leapfrogging current development and going straight to multi- GW projects, as some other emerging markets are hoping to do.\\nNEDO’s Green Innovation Fund is supporting floating wind development in Japan in two phases.\\nThe projects will build on the experience of the Japanese supply chain and demonstrate floating wind in Japanese waters.\\nPhase 1 is comprised of 18 R&D projects, split into four areas of focus, that will last 2 years (2022-2024).\\nCompanies were selected for each project in Q1 2022 (a selection is shown on the right).\\nPhase 1 has a subsidy of ¥34.5bn (€262m).\\nPhase 1-1 focuses on the development of larger wind turbines.\\nPhase 1-2 is for the optimization and mass production of floating offshore wind foundations and the improvement of manufacturing and installation processes to achieve cost reductions.\\nThe aim is to commercialize Japanese floating wind at internationally competitive costs.\\nPhase 1-3 is dedicated to the development of electrical components, prioritizing R&D in dynamic cables and floating substations.\\nPhase 1-4 focuses on the improvement of operations and maintenance (O&M) for offshore wind.\\nIn Phase 2, demonstrations that integrate the cost-reducing, innovative, and upscaled designs of wind turbines, floating foundations, cables, and mooring systems will be deployed beginning in 2024, with the announcement of demonstration areas and the selection of developers expected between June 2023 and March 2024.\\nPhase 2 has a subsidy of ¥85 billion (€664.5 million) for eight years.\\nPre-commercial scale integrated demonstration of turbine, floaters, cable, moorings, etc.\\nreductions in floating wind (TLP) system for cost reductions in hybrid spars for 15 MW turbines Japan: Step by Step with the Green Innovation Fund Projects supported by the Green Innovation Fund  Japan: Green Innovation Fund (Phase 1-2) Mass production and cost reductions in floating wind installation (semi-subs) Technical verification for cost reductions in floating wind (tension leg platform, TLP) Japan Marine United (JMU), Nihon Shipyard, K Line, and Toa Construction are working together to design a semi-submersible platform for a 12-15 MW turbine and achieve cost reductions in FOW with hybrid moorings.\\nThe companies bring together extensive engineering, vessel operation, shipbuilding, and marine construction experience.\\nJMU previously deployed an advanced spar floater for a 5 MW turbine, as part of Fukushima Forward.\\nJMU will be responsible for fabrication of the floater, having obtained a statement of feasibility from DNV in June 2021 for a semi-submersible designed for a >12 MW turbine.\\nTo date, the consortium has deployed a scaled model offshore of Akita City and Katagami City in northern Japan.\\nMODEC, Toyo Construction, Furukawa Electric, and JERA are participating as a consortium in the development of a TLP for a 15 MW turbine.\\nMODEC has experience stemming from Oil and Gas – in supplying FPSOs and TLPs.\\nTo date, TLPs have not been tested for offshore wind, making it an essential project for future export of Japanese floater technology.\\nThe use of TLPs (compared with semi- subs) is more space-efficient.\\nUsing a 14 MW turbine as an example, MODEC’s study concluded that 18 TLPs (252 MW) could be deployed in a 4.6 x 11.2 km site, compared with just 10 semi-subs.\\nIn August 2022, the consortium launched a subsea ground survey in Ishikari Bay, Hokkaido prefecture in preparation of testing the TLP in future.\\nDevelopment of mass production system for cost reductions in hybrid spars for 15 MW turbines Foundation manufacturing and cost reduction of installation technology (large spar) TODA has begun integrating turbine components on floaters for the 16.8 MW Goto wind farm, with start to commercial operations planned in January 2024.\\nAs part of the Green Innovation Fund, TODA is developing a hybrid spar for a 10-15 MW turbine, with the aim of commercializing a turbine demo by 2025.\\nThe foundation, much like the deployed hybrid TODA spar for 2-2.1 MW turbines, will have an upper half composed of steel and a lower half of concrete.\\nThe floater has simple structural design, composed of 11 steel rings of two differing sizes and 17 concrete rings for the lower part, making mass production cheaper and logistically easier.\\nIn addition, no active ballast is required.\\nTEPCO is participating in the Green Innovation Fund by developing a spar for a 10-15 MW turbine.\\nThe spar for a 10 MW turbine would be 122.5 m in height, have an operational draft of 97.5 m, be 18 m wide, and weigh 22,000 t (inc. ballast).\\nTEPCO are aiming to reduce costs to an LCOE less than ¥20/kWh (€138/MWh) by 2030, corresponding to a reduction of CAPEX from the current ¥900/MW (€6.23/MW) down to ¥450/MW (€3.12/MW) for floating wind.\\nEarly designs for a 10 MW floating turbine, including the use of a hybrid mooring system, are expected to contribute to these cost reductions.\\nTEPCO will develop the spar until ~2024, with demonstration thereafter.\\nMass production and cost reduction of hybrid semi-subs Mass production and cost reduction of manufacturing and installing semi-subs Hitachi Zosen (Hitz) and Kajima are working on developing a hybrid semi-sub for a 10-15 MW turbine.\\nFollowing the themes of the Green Innovation Fund projects, Hitz are optimizing the floater and focusing on cost reductions and mass production.\\nThe floater will incorporate a hybrid mooring system (chain and synthetic rope), which is cheaper than conventional chain mooring for the project.\\nPreviously, Hitz has worked with France’s Naval Energies to jointly design and build floaters for the Japanese industry.\\nTokyo Gas was also selected in January 2022 by NEDO to benefit from the Green Innovation Fund.\\nThe company will contribute to the expansion of floating wind in Japan through the development of low-cost technology for manufacturing and installing Principle Power’s WindFloat platform for larger turbines (15 MW).\\nTokyo Gas has been a major shareholder of Principle Power since 2020 and believes WindFloat to be a commercializable concept within the Japanese market.\\nThe floater will be stabilized by dynamic ballast control (passive ballast).\\nImages sourced from JMU, MODEC, TODA, TEPCO, Hitz, and Principle Power.\\nJapan: Floating out Goto Wind Japan’s first offshore wind tender was for a 16.8 MW floating project (8 x HTW2.1-80) off the coast of Goto City/Sakiyama in Nagasaki Prefecture.\\nThe site was awarded in 2021 to a consortium led by TODA.\\nThe project is expected to begin commercial operations in January 2024 and will earn ¥36/kWh (€250/MWh) for a period of 20 years.\\nSpars will be transported from Fukue Port (1) to the sea area north of Kabashima (2), an intermediary site, where the foundations will be placed in the water, upended, and turbine components will be assembled on top of the foundations.\\nAfterwards, the floating units (foundation + turbine) will be towed to the final site, approximately 5 km off the coast of Sakiyama (3), for hook-up to the mooring system.\\nL x W x H (m) 7.8 x 7.8 x 88 Image: Nagasaki Prefecture, METI, MLIT  Float Raiser vessel, a semi- Spar loaded

energy policy.\\nThe reversal of the previous government’s nuclear phase-out means new reactors will be built and policy will be rewritten to factor in expanding nuclear capacity to a proposed 201.7 GW in 2030, pending the finalization of the 10th Basic Electricity Plan in December 2022.\\nA draft of the Plan was published in August 2022.\\nIn the draft, the proportion of nuclear energy in the mix to 2030 increased from 23.9% to 32.8%, while the proportion of renewables decreased from 30.2% to 21.5%, corresponding to a 52.9 GW decrease in expected total capacity in 2030 (from 185.2 GW to 132.3 GW), potentially decelerating floating wind deployment.\\nRenewables Proportion of the Mix 9th Basic Plan (Dec 2020) Revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC, Nov 2021) Draft of 10th Basic Plan (Aug. 2022) - 9 GW off Ulsan - 900 MW off Pohang - 1 GW ‘Rising Sun’ project - 500-600 MW off Jindo - 500 MW off Yeosu (Geomundo) - 1.2 GW off Yeonggwang The Goto wind farm (16.8 MW) and single-turbine Haenkaze (2 MW) demonstration, both led by TODA Corporation, had similar methods for the transportation and installation of the TODA spar floater and accompanying 2 MW turbine.\\nThe key difference between the processes for both projects is in the foundation deployment stage, where upending in Haenkaze was performed by a heavy-lift crane vessel, whereas in Goto, it was performed passively by filling the spar’s ballast with seawater, hence not requiring the expensive vessel until turbine integration.\\nAnother difference was that in the Goto project, the tower of the turbine was integrated onto the spar before float out (dry tow), whereas in Haenkaze, tower, nacelle, and blades had to be installed on the upended foundation at sea..\\nGross ownership in major confirmed

floating wind farms off the coast of Ulsan began in 2018 with the deployment of the first fLiDAR.\\nLocal and foreign developers expressed interest in transforming the Donghae gas field into a site for offshore wind.\\nWith water depths in the region exceeding 120m and reaching 400 m, floating wind was the natural option.\\nThe complex was originally intended to have a capacity of 6 GW, with consortia involving Shell, SK and CIP, Macquarie, Equinor, and the KFWind venture signing individual MoUs with Ulsan Metropolitan City in 2019.\\nIn November 2021, RWE and BayWa r.e.\\nalso signed MoUs to begin development on a further 3 GW, corresponding to 1.5 GW each.\\nThe capacity was officially raised to 9 GW shortly after.\\nTo date, there have been several calls from local stakeholders – primarily fisheries, advocacy groups, and residents – to cancel the 9 GW complex.\\nGiven the momentum of development, however, cancellation seems highly unlikely, although deployment may be slowed down.\\nNearly all projects have received an Electric Business License (EBL) for phases of development, corresponding to at least 6.7 GW with site exclusivity.\\nA strong supply chain has already began to form around the projects, with Vestas, Sejin Heavy Industries and Construction, Ulsan Port Authority, and Ulsan Metropolitan City committed to developing the infrastructure for the 9 GW.\\nBureau Veritas and Korean Register will provide support in the form of certification and technical advice.\\nIn October 2022, the Korean Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering (KRISO) received approval in principle (AIP) of a floating foundation for a 15 MW turbine.\\nSeveral projects, including Firefly, MunmuBaram, and KFWIND, will co-develop offshore transmission.\\nThrough collaboration and early securing of contracts, the Ulsan cluster may make Korea the world leader in floating wind by 2030 and 2035.\\n4C expects the first phases (each around 400-500 MW in size) to enter offshore construction around 2027-28, with later phases to follow and full commissioning to be achieved by the mid 2030’s.\\nCTGNE Yangjiang Shapa phase III Zhanjiang 6.2 MW floating demo Taiwan: 100 MW Floating Wind Tender In August, Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MoEA) held a meeting to discuss floating offshore wind in Taiwan, unveiling a draft plan for a 100 MW demonstration project.\\nThe final plan is expected to ready in Q4 2022.\\nWhat is known so far: 100 MW total capacity split into two projects.\\nMaximum project capacity of 50 MW.\\nMust be grid connected by 2026 (See timeline) FiT Mechanism expected like that seen for Formosa 1 in the first round of bottom-fixed.\\nLonger-term build out will be dependent on the suitability of sites in the Taiwan straight for fixed v floating wind and development of the Kaohsiung area to the south.\\nTaiwan’s long-term goal to become a regional hub for offshore wind depends on an ability to export its expertise, skilled labour, and technology to its regional comparative to its neighbours lies in its experience in fixed-bottom wind.\\nTo maximise its expansion in potential, several improvements are needed; 1.\\nPort expansion and infrastructure improvement.\\nThere is currently insufficient space to support the fabrication of floaters or float-out.\\n2.\\nIncreased workforce.\\nLocally sourced and skilled workforce for offshore wind needs to be increased.\\nMore workers are needed and long- term reliance on foreign labour must decrease.\\n3.\\nSupply Chain Development.\\nLocal content requirements make it essential for Taiwanese companies to develop experience, for example in floater fabrication, to be able to build floating wind farms in Taiwan (and abroad in future).\\nChina: >1 GW by 2030 on the horizon China, which is estimated to have more than 2,000 GW of floating wind potential, has made its first commitments to large-scale floating wind.\\nIn October 2022, the Wanning government of Hainan Province and China Power Hainan signed a cooperation agreement to jointly build the country's first 1 GW floating wind farm, a key project of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025).\\nThe project will be built in two phases, with a 200 MW first phase built in the mid 2020’s and an 800 MW extension before 2030.\\nIt is unclear how well developed the Chinese supply chain is for floating wind, but China has impressive steel and concrete production capabilities, vessels, transferrable skills from shipbuilding and oil and gas, and the world’s largest workforce.\\nChina also boasts fast manufacturing and installation rates, as evidenced by the installation of 17 GW of fixed-bottom wind in 2021 alone.\\nThe 1GW project at Wanning will be China’s first large-scale floating wind farm.\\nAdditionally, there are seven floating demonstrations under construction or in development (see table below).\\nAreas (red) identified by MoEA as having potential for  Philippines: 53 GW of Floating Development Zones The Philippines’ total offshore wind potential is estimated at 178 GW, including 160 GW (90%) Floating and 18 GW (10%) of fixed-bottom wind.\\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) released its offshore wind roadmap in June 2022.\\nSix development zones have been identified (table & left-most map) for up to 58 GW.\\nFloating potential across all areas is considerably higher than fixed, with Southern Mindoro having the maximum floating potential of any zone at ~36 GW.\\nOffshore Wind Zones include exclusion areas of high environmental or social sensitivity and restriction areas, which require further analysis before designation (middle map).\\nThe Northwest Luzon zone overlaps with the important marine mammal area (IMMA), while some zones have small exclusions within them to be considered by project developers.\\nWater depths range from 20-1000 m in all potential zones (right-most map), with the Guimaras strait area that is suitable for fixed bottom foundations, having the shallowest water depth at ~20 meters.\\nThe maximum water depth is between 100 and 1000 m in Northwest Luzon and Southern Mindoro, which are both suitable for floating wind.\\nDevelopment Scenarios: The road map explores high and low growth scenarios (bottom left).\\nBoth suggest deployment of fixed turbines to 2030 and transition to floating wind between 2030 and 2035.\\nUnder the low growth scenario floating is first installed in 2034 and totals ~8 GW by 2050.\\nThe high growth scenario sees floating from 2030, reaching up to 38 GW by 2050.\\nLCOE: The initial costs for floating offshore wind (in 2028) are expected to be around a third higher in the Philippines (~€107/MWh) than in established markets (~€80/MWh) due to limited experience, infrastructure, and resources driving up costs.\\nThe LCOE gap is expected to reduce partially over time.\\nPotential Zones with Environmental Factors Potential Zones with Offshore Wind

feasibility studies up to financial close.\\nThe 4C Offshore database contains 40 projects of ~25 GW that have received a WESC.\\nBased on the proposed locations of announced windfarms, ~76% projects are expected to be in floating zones (~19 GW).\\nLocal companies are partnering with international players; WindKraft with Iberdrola, PetroGreen with Denmark’s Copenhagen Energy, and CleanTech with Singapore-based The Blue Circle.\\nDomhain Energy has planned the most capacity (3 GW) with two floating wind farms, followed by ACX3 and PetroGreen - ~2.5 GW each (below chart).\\nTotal Power has been awarded the WESC of two offshore wind projects of ~4.3 GW; however, the DOE list only includes one project of 900 MW.\\nThe Philippines has significant potential for floating offshore wind but seeing the global slow growth and higher costs of floating offshore wind technology, large floating projects are not expected this side of 2030, even under a high growth scenario.\\nBlue Circle / Clean Tech Announced Floating Wind Pipeline by Ownership and Development Zone (MW) - : Outside of Zones  The new Albanese government intends reshape the energy sector, pledging to increase renewables from 29% to 82% of electricity generation by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050.\\nThe transition has been accelerated with impending closure of power stations over the next decade.\\nReportedly, the country will need 96 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2035 to meet targets.\\nAustralia has >7,000 TWh/yr (2,000 GW) of offshore wind technical potential, according to the IEA, which increases to 16,000 TWh/yr when including >60m water depth.\\nMost states have floating potential, with New South Wales (NSW) almost exclusively suitable for floating.\\nAustralia currently has a 22.3 GW floating wind pipeline across NSW and Victoria (VIC) (map), with individual projects exceed 1 GW (map).\\nConsidering the nascence of the market in terms of framework, supply chain, and supporting infrastructure, and given that floating wind is yet to be deployed at this scale, it is likely that projects will be developed in phases, beginning in the 2030’s (see Challenges Box, table on next slide).\\nFederal licensing regulations came into force in June followed by the proposal of the first offshore wind leasing area off Gippsland, Victoria, where water depths extend to 80m (Q2 & Q3 2022

Act 2021 (OEI) (schematic, below).\\nFive other potential areas have also been identified for development.\\nThese are the Pacific regions off the coast of Hunter and Illawarra in NSW, the Southern Ocean region off Portland in Victoria, the Bass Strait off northern Tasmania, and the region off Perth in Western Australia.\\nThe Albanese Government’s Rewiring the Nation Plan prioritizes offshore wind zones in Victoria, with the goal of job creation and securing green energy supply via transmission network expansion.\\nThe agreement between Victoria and the Commonwealth sets out: $1.5bn (€1bn) of concessional financing for REZ projects in Victoria, commitment to coordinate Victorian State and Commonwealth concessional loan of $750 m (€500m) through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, for NSW Interconnector (VNI West) KerangLink contributions between Victoria, Tasmania & Commonwealth Governments to a total of 20% of project equity to deliver Marinus Link.\\nAustralia: Specified Zones

autumn, outlining initial government plans and schedules: Transmission: VicGrid, a new body in the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, will coordinate the planning of Victorian renewable energy zones (REZ), including a co-ordinated grid for offshore wind.\\nDevelopers will be responsible for radial connections to dedicated 500 kV grid connection points, located on Gippsland Coast and Portland.\\nPorts: The Port of Hastings has been identified as the preferred construction port for offshore wind.\\nPort development could commence Q1 2025 with phased opening from Q2 2027.The Port of Hastings has land available adjacent to naturally deep shipping channels and has extensive appropriately zoned land that could be developed to support offshore wind, including local manufacturing.\\nIndependently, Geelong Port, located in Corio Bay has unveiled plans to develop up to 25 ha of land for a wind energy hub.\\nIt will incorporate the purpose-built facilities needed for a wind farm construction feeder port.\\nPolicy, legislation, regulations: Offshore Wind Energy Victoria (OWEV) will be a dedicated office to support establishment.\\nInformation on support

the demonstration scale market Demonstration scale floating foundation designers’ pipeline The platform with the largest pipeline is currently Hexicon’s TwinWind design, which has 7.1 GW in development.\\nThe first demo of the platform is expected at the Metcentre in 2023, after which the technology will rapidly scale up for commercial scale.\\nGustoMSC comes second with their Tri-floater.\\nThe capacity of Aspen, Beech South and Beech North increased from 1 GW to 1.5 GW each, extending GustoMSC’s portfolio to 4.5 GW.\\nStiesdal’s TetraSub has been chosen by CIP for the Pentland project off the north coast of Scotland.\\nThe technology will be trialed for the upcoming ~15 MW first turbine, so that design optimizations can be planned for the other 6 turbines (bringing capacity of the full project up to 100 MW).\\nCIP clearly favours Steisdal’s designs, having also chosen a Tetra Concept for their projects in Korea (Donghae – White Heron East I, II and III) and two projects in Italy.\\nMarine Power Systems has an upcoming demo for Pelaflex at the BiMEP test site in Spain, and recently announced a partnership with WavEC to test Pelaflex at the Aguçadoura test site offshore Viana do Castelo.\\nMPS has also partnered with Simply Blue to submit a 100 MW project in the INTOG leasing round.\\nOn top of this, RWE signed a contract with MPS to explore feasibility of developing 1 GW of floating wind in the Celtic Sea.\\nAlthough new to the market, developers are clearly recognizing the practicalities of the simple TLP design.\\nTODA currently has 18.8 MW in development.\\nA 2 MW demo of TODA’s spar is currently operating offshore Fukue Island in Japan, and 16.8 MW is currently under construction in Goto City.\\nThe first spar for this project (with tower pre-integrated) was placed in the water and upended in October.\\nIn the future, TODA will work on developing a larger hybrid spar for a 10-15 MW turbine.\\nEnBW follows closely with 16.8 MW in development.\\nA 0.2 MW demonstration of Nezzy2 took place in Denmark in 2020, and 16.6 MW is due to be installed in the South China Sea in end-2022/early 2023 depending on weather windows.\\nX1 Wind’s PivotBuoy was finally installed at the PLOCAN test site after a suitable weather window opened up at the end of October.\\nCommissioning was delayed due to COVID, and a volcanic eruption in the Canaries late 2021.\\nBlueFloat, Iberdrola and Hexicon taking the lead in 10 major markets Pipeline (gross) of the major players excluding minor markets (e.g., Colombia, Sweden, Australia, NZ) BlueFloat is developing projects across the globe, with a particularly large pipeline in Europe.\\nThe company is developing 3 floating wind farms in Scotland with partner Falck Renewables – Bellrock, Broadshore, and Stromar (also with Ørsted) – and has begun investigating multi-GW deployments in Italy and Spain.\\nBlueFloat has also set its sights on new floating markets like Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, and Colombia, pushing its global ambitions to over 20 GW (inc. fixed-bottom).\\nIberdrola has a huge renewables pipeline planned across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, with an increasing focus on offshore wind as technological advancements bring down cost of development per MW of capacity.\\n4C is tracking 11.1 GW of floating wind projects that Iberdrola has announced.\\nThe company is leading the Flagship project, which will incorporate a 10 MW turbine supported on a concrete semi-submersible.\\nIberdrola plans to have 12 GW of offshore wind operational by 2030, some of that floating.\\nHexicon is pursuing projects in Italy, South Korea, the UK, and more.\\nIn Korea, it has secured site exclusivity for over 2 GW.\\nIn Italy, maritime concession applications have been submitted for 5 sites off Puglia, Sardinia, and Sicily, equating to over 5 GW, with ~2.5 GW worth (2 projects) securing site exclusivity.\\nIn early scoping reports, Hexicon has proposed the use of 2 x 25 MW turbines per foundation.\\nIn UK, Hexicon won the first ever Contract for Difference (CfD) auction for FOW with TwinHub and has selected MingYang as preferred turbine supplier.\\nShell has announced several large-scale floating wind farms in Europe and Asia, with a pipeline exceeding 5 GW in the UK and 3 GW across South Korea and Taiwan (through subsidiary EOLFI).\\nThe 1.3 GW ‘MunmuBaram’ project, planned off the coast of Ulsan in Korea, is expected to use 20%-partner Hexicon’s dual-turbine concept, TwinWind, to demonstrate 2 x 6-8 MW turbines per foundation (upper rating estimated).\\nShell recently also exited 2.65 GW worth of floating projects, previously being co-developed with Simply Blue, in Ireland.\\nIn November, TEPCO announced that it was acquiring Scottish floating wind developer Flotation Energy, which has a portfolio of 7.5 GW of floating projects proposed in Japan, Taiwan, Scotland, and Ireland.\\nTEPCO is solidly building its experience in preparation for the commercialization of floating wind in Japan in the 2030’s.\\nPreviously, TEPCO participated in the TetraSpar demo in Norway.\\nAs part of Japan’s Green Innovation Fund, it will develop a spar floater for a 10-15 MW turbine for deployment in the Japanese industry and potentially abroad in the future.\\nGerman multinational corporation RWE has a considerable portfolio of early-stage developments in Asia, specifically in Taiwan and South Korea.\\nIn November 2021, RWE signed an MoU with Ulsan City for the development of a 1.5 GW project within the 9 GW floating wind complex off Ulsan, Korea, making it the latest addition.\\nRWE is involved in three floating demonstrations – DemoSATH barge (2 MW), TetraSpar (3.6 MW), and the New England Aqua Ventus concrete semi- submersible (11 MW).\\nThe floater was towed from Hitachi-Zosen’s Sakai plant dockyard to Sumoto Port, where it tilted 45 degrees on transit The foundation was upended and the turbine installed at quayside using onshore cranes, with the spar set down on the seabed The unit was then towed 517 miles to Fukushima using four vessels, this took 8 days The unit was hooked up to the moorings and then the array cable was installed, connecting the turbine to the substation Floaters were wet-towed horizontally to sheltered water in an adjacent fjord (wave heights Floaters were upended using a water ballast.\\nWater was pumped out and filled with a solid Heavy lift vessel, Saipem 7000, assembled the towers and rotors onto the foundations The assembled units were then towed over 4 days to the offshore location and connected to the pre-installed mooring lines, then final ballast corrections were made The foundations were loaded-out by an SPMT onto a semi-submersible barge, and then The foundation was then towed using tugs and then moored at quayside for WTG installation using a heavy lift crane The assembled units were then towed by AHTS Bourbon Orca over 3 days to the offshore location, where the foundation is connected to the pre-installed moorings and cables.\\nThe Tetraspar foundation was loaded onto a submersible barge using SMTPs The keel was then submerged alongside the foundation in the same process The WTG was installed on the foundation using an onshore crane at the quayside The keel was placed beneath the foundation, and the fully assembled unit towed to the offshore location and hooked up.\\nThe keel was then lowered and ballasted at sufficient water depth.\\nOnce the structure reached the offshore location, it was hooked up to moorings and cables.\\nThe concrete spar starts off by being slip formed vertically in a dry dock.\\nThe structure is then towed using tugs to a deep-water quayside for the completion of the substructure, again with slip forming.\\nThe WTG is installed on the spar at a deep-water quayside, then towed to the offshore location using tugs and an AHTS where it is hooked up to moorings and cables.\\n*Start of WTG installation to end of hook up DpT = days per turbine  Floating foundations are currently towed back to port for maintenance and repairs.\\nThe foundation is disconnected from cables and moorings using an anchor handling tug supply (AHTS), then towed back to port using tugs.\\nThis process has several requirements, outlined below: Suitable weather window for the disconnection and towing process, limited to significant wave heights and wind speeds Availability of tugs and AHTS to perform the procedure Availability of ports to accommodate the foundation.\\nIncreasing demand for ports for floating wind construction, assembly, and storage reduces the availability for O&M activity.\\nAvailability of ports with sufficient quayside water depth.\\nSemi- submersibles, barges and TLP’s require ports with a quayside water depth of 10 – 12 m, where as spar’s need very deep sheltered water.\\nAvailability of suitable quayside cranes or jack-up barges.\\nThe Kincardine offshore wind farm (50 MW) has demonstrated the tow-to- port method, highlighting some significant challenges.\\nIn July, turbine KIN-03 was towed to Rotterdam for servicing, returning on-site in August.\\nFour vessels were involved in the disconnection and tow.\\nThe two-month process will prove to be costly – both in terms of vessel hire and turbine downtime.\\nThe current method of towing turbines to port one at a time would not be technically or financially feasible for a larger wind farm, especially if several vessels, some with rather expensive day rates, are required.\\nIn winter, this process could take much longer due to shorter weather windows.\\nSince KIN-03, another turbine is expected to be disconnected and towed to port for servicing in the future.\\nMany of the new floating wind concepts are designed to be left in situ, thus relying on future floating-to-floating O&M solutions.\\nTechnology and vessels for undertaking large component repair and replacement have not been developed, and many technologies have not been designed with O&M methodology in mind.\\nHowever, a few floating-to-floating solutions have been introduced, see table on right.\\nImpact of concept design on O&M The motion of a floating foundation will have significant impact on O&M, as increased motions will pose risks to the turbine, moorings, cables, and the sub-structure itself.\\nFred.\\nOlsen has developed a Floating Maintenance Solution, suitable for most semi- submersibles.\\nThis solution removes the need for disconnection and tow to port, by performing on site maintenance.\\nA crane is positioned on the floater, so that gearbox, generator and blade replacement can take place with the same motions.\\nFred.\\nOlsen signed and MoU with Huisman who will supply the crane.\\nThe SENSE Self Erect Tower removes the need for a large crane for both installation and O&M activities, and also allows for O&M offshore.\\nThe rotor nacelle assembly (RNA) unit is installed at the base of the tower and lifted up using a transport carriage, to either install or remove the nacelle and blades.\\nThis means component exchange can take place without towing the whole structure to port.\\nHeerema has a floating to floating installation method, which can also deliver offshore maintenance solutions.\\nThe floating installation frame lifts the floater from the vessel, and submerges it down by weight into the water.\\nThe WTG is then installed on the foundation.\\nFor component exchange, the turbine can be removed, leaving the foundation in place.\\nDolfines modular solution for O&M involves a heavy lift vessel, and their Offshore Heavy Maintenance enabler (OHMe) which is compatible with most semi-subs and barges.\\nThe enabler is fixed on to the foundation with its temporary support structure, and has a blade handling tool and top crane which elevates up to the hub to perform maintenance works.\\n▪ Barges and semi-submersibles experience higher motions than spars and TLPs ▪ A steel substructure carries risk of corrosion ▪ An active ballast system requires more servicing and repairs than a passive ▪ A design with the turbine in the centre of the foundation reduces crane ▪ A weathervaning concept replaces need for complex active yaw system, thus ▪ Increased motion of the foundation will increase risk to the turbine components, even small motions get amplified into large displacement at the ▪ Foundation designs with a turbine integrated into the sub-structure reduces blade induced vibrations and fatigue ▪ The need for dampeners and blade stiffeners can be avoided with zero tilt angle (see Eolink’s foundation design) ▪ A downwind configuration reduces risk of tower strikes (see X1 Wind design) ▪ Depending on the mooring materials, there will be risk of corrosion, fatigue, and damage caused by bending and twisting ▪ TLP designs with taut mooring have high vertical tension that can experience fatigue, and also require re-tensioning operations ▪ Semi-submersibles and barges experience higher motions which increases risk of fatigue to the moorings ▪ Regular inspection will be required for all mooring systems ▪ Wave induced action and seabed interaction on the cable can cause cable fatigue, material ageing, material incompatibility, vortex induced vibration, structural abrasion, transition jointing (connectors for static to dynamic transition) and marine growth.\\n▪ Regular inspection is required for all cable systems risk of fatigue to the cables ▪ Efficient disconnection methods are being developed, such

DISTRIBUTION Welcome to the Q1 2023 edition of 4C Offshore’s Global Market Overview slide deck, part of your Global Offshore Wind Intelligence subscription.\\nThis concise, forward-looking overview keeps you informed of emerging demand for offshore wind across established and new markets around the globe.\\nBuilding on last quarter’s Market Scorecard, our Market Dashboard provides an at-a-glance roundup of pipelines, prices, and timeframes, letting you spot and understand the trends.\\nOur Market Attractiveness Index for Floating Wind debuts here.\\nIn future, it will appear in our bi-annual Global Floating Wind Report.\\nThis index shows that, while Norway leads the world with the highest installed capacity of floating wind, the United Kingdom is the most attractive market for the technology.\\nHowever, despite its proven regulatory framework and a growing pipeline of sites, the UK still has long-term uncertainty in its floating wind ambition.\\nEnergy companies continue to make striking profits, but renewables are not necessarily the winners in this scenario.\\nVolatile energy prices and supply chain constraints – especially the price of steel – have impacted project plans around the world.\\nIn the US, as well as seeing delayed timelines, we have seen questions over affordability and developers such as Eversource considering their portfolio stakes.\\nInvestments in offshore wind energy have been down, and as discussed last quarter, 2022 saw a record-low rate of final investment decisions.\\nLeading developer Ørsted, while achieving its highest ever adjusted earnings last quarter, saw a decrease in earnings from its offshore business and expects to miss its 2023 green generation target (see ‘Corporate Catch-Up’).\\nEven China, which leads the world for installed capacity, saw a 79% decline in installation activity in 2022 compared to 2021.\\nGovernments are working to buoy confidence in renewable technology, especially offshore wind.\\nThe American Inflation Reduction Act of last year, with its $369 bn investment in clean energy, is having a tangible effect on establishing a domestic supply chain.\\nThis quarter, the European Union proposed its own Net-Zero Industry Act, aiming to counter the IRA’s impacts on competitiveness and the volatile energy market with flexible state aid ad increased grants and investments.\\nStill, offshore wind remains attractive and competitive, evidenced by the multiple auctions and tenders expected in 2023.\\nThese include first auctions in Norway, Ireland, Uruguay, Lithuania, Colombia, and Australia.\\nOur webinar to accompany this edition features a focus on some of these markets.\\nForecasting to 2030 and Beyond This report examines the global buildout to 2030, including auction timelines and results and our forward- looking six-month global calendar.\\nOur country analysis dives into 30 national markets, identifying new and upcoming policy shifts and auction activities across Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific.\\nOur accompanying Project Opportunity Pipeline (POP) forecast to 2035 provides additional insights into the long term, as markets around the world continue to grow and emerge.\\nTogether, our suite of reports, project databases, newsletters, and online charts provides you with a comprehensive and unrivalled market intelligence toolkit for

established and proven regulatory framework, plus a large pipeline of sites makes the UK the most attractive floating market.\\nAlthough leader, the UK has long-term uncertainty in its ambition for floating.\\nDemand for offshore wind is undisputed, but the volume of floating remains uncertain (see Floating Wind Progress Update H2 2022), with widely ranging scenarios from 6-61 GW.\\nUnlike the UK, Norway is constrained to deep waters and scores high for ambition, with a low threat of nuclear substitution and strong resistance to onshore wind.\\nIts score is boosted by its deployments to date and comparatively strong supply chain experience in maritime and deployment of large steel structures.\\nStill in design, orway’s regulatory frameworks are yet to be fully established for deployment in offshore wind (beyond O&G electrification).\\nSouth Korea scores highly in the index, particularly due to its supply chain strengths, given strong capabilities in foundation manufacturing for fixed-bottom offshore wind, shipbuilding, steel manufacturing, and turbine manufacturing.\\nThere are solid plans for the expansion and development of industrial complexes to support large-scale offshore wind deployment.\\nDeveloper-led site selection, early award of site exclusivity (compared with auction markets), opportunities set up by the previous administration, and a new target of 30.6% generation by renewables in 2036 make Korea an attractive market for early project development.\\nJapan and the USA score similarly, differentiated by more established processes in the USA (larger capacity awarded through auction), yet more deployment in Japan.\\nUS processes for leasing and consenting are well established by BOEM, but floating states (CA, MA, OR) lack routes to market.\\nIn Japan, the regulatory environment is maturing but is not yet available beyond the 12 nautical mile territorial sea area.\\nWhile connecting offshore wind in California to the grid faces challenges, its daily and seasonal generation profile complements solar.\\nThe threat of substitutes is higher in Maine and Oregon.\\nforecasts to 2030 and 2035, and Pro-rated sum of projects post- Pro-rated sum of projects with site exclusivity or in leasing for (i) leasing, (ii) consenting and (iii) offtake.\\nOfftake amount also factors into weighing.\\nNo evidence of process.\\nProcess may exist as plan in roadmap or political ambition.\\nProcess in draft format, or being drafted.\\nProcess enacted.\\nFirst projects may be moving through process.\\nProcesses established and operating for multiple projects.\\nNo evidence of domestic supply chain capable of delivering main components, or capable ports, and no planned investments in facilities.\\nSupply chain with some experience in delivering offshore wind (or related industry) and plans, or access to funding for extending capabilities into floating wind.\\nSupply chain with relevant experience in floating wind (or extensive shipbuilding/ O&G/fixed-bottom wind) and investments underway in positioning ports and facilities for scaling up.\\nSupply chain and ports capable of delivering main components at scale.\\n0 to 6 depending on strength underway.\\n0 to 6 depending on ability for floating to be substituted (0) or the only option (6).\\n0 to 3 depending on expected costs (lower the better) and and early investment risks.\\nAwarded pro-rata relative to the highest figure and multiplied by maximum score for each factor.\\nE.g.\\nIf Country A has the highest figure with 10 GW it will score highest points in that particular category.\\nKey floating wind markets were researched (following slide) and scored across seven factors which influence floating wind development.\\nA mixture of qualitative and quantitative scoring frameworks were used (below) which result in a maximum available score of 100 points.\\nThe relative importance of each of the factors can be debated, and changing the weightings will result in different results.\\nHowever the underlying process is comprehensive and based on objective factors, therefore providing a framework with which to comparatively assess the strengths and weaknesses of markets.\\nComparative Assessment of Floating Wind Markets b: target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 c: Capacity leased or in leasing

reducing its dependence on fossil fuels.\\nOne measure proposed to launch a study to increase ambition for 8 GW renewable production capacity at sea.\\nIncreased capacity could be implemented Identification of new offshore wind zones, although Belgium is somewhat spatially limited, so capacity could also be achieved through accelerated repowering of the first offshore wind zone.\\nInstallation of floating solar panels.\\nBelgian authorities will refine the above ambitions and formalize into legislation.\\nThe Marine Spatial Plan will be updated for 2026.\\nIn parallel, Elia will launch new studies to identify grid reinforcement requirements.\\nFor repowering, infrastructure needs to be optimized and bottlenecks removed, e.g.\\nstrengthening the Gezelle - Van Maerlant axis and an additional 220 kV offshore cable from the MOG.\\nCurrently there is 2.2 GW capacity over 177 km2 in the first Belgian offshore wind zone, with the oldest projects operating for 15 years, and the most recent commissioned in 2020.\\nNew Support Mechanism to Limit Profits The federal government has reached an agreement in principle on changes to the support mechanism for five ‘youngest’ wind farms (table, next slide), in response to the ongoing energy crisis and market price higher than € 30/MWh.\\nThe current subsidy mechanism is variable based on the fixed reference price for electricity (LCOE).\\nUnder the revised proposal, projects will pay back part of the profits when electricity prices are high under a two-way Contracts for Difference (CfD) mechanism to limit excess profits and reduce consumer costs (continued).\\nUnder the current support scheme, domain concession holders receive renewable energy certificates from the Belgian federal energy regulator (CREG) for each MWh of offshore electricity production.\\nGrid operator Elia is obliged to purchase the certificates under Electricity Law at a minimum price.\\nFor projects which reached FID from 2014-2016, the minimum price was based on LCOE, calculated per project, and the electricity reference price based on the previous year market price and is “corrected” by factoring in grid energy losses and a correction factor which is calculated annually by CREG.\\nMinimum price = LCOE (levelized cost of energy) − For 2023 onwards, the reference price is higher than the LCOE, and developers are projected to reap the rewards in 2023-2025 (table).\\nUnder the proposed two-way CfD scheme, profits will need to be paid back to the state, as opposed to operators receiving excess profits.\\nIt is unclear how high the ceiling can go.\\nAn amendment to the Royal Decree of 16th July 2002 is necessary, as is European Commission approval.\\nPending approval, the new regime would come into force in 2023 and for the duration of the subsidy scheme (16 years).\\nOlder projects continue to operate under fixed support.\\nThese include C-Power, Belwind, Northwind, and Nobelwind, securing a minimum price of € 0 /MWh for the first 2 MW of installed capacity and € 0/MWh thereafter.\\nThese parks hold 20-year contracts and, according to energy regulator CREG, do not make any excess profits.\\nThe Danish Energy Agency (DEA) is halting its ‘Open- oor’ scheme for offshore wind development, until further notice on the grounds that it could contravene European Union laws.\\nAll submitted applications have been put on hold and no new applications will be accepted until the government’s investigations are complete.\\nThe scheme formed part of the two-pronged approach to offshore wind licensing in Denmark: 1.\\nGovernment-led auctions whereby the state defines the area and size of the potential wind farm and developers bid fixed kWh CfD offtake agreement.\\n2.\\nThe ‘open-door’ scheme (now suspended), wherein the developer identifies an area and applies to carry out preliminary investigations.\\nThe DEA acts as the single point of contact for the developer, liaising with various public bodies, assessing the application and then approving the feasibility study permit, establishment permit, and permit for energy utilization.\\nThe Open Door programme has been active since 1999.\\nIn recent years applications had faced slow permitting progress and delays, whereas during Spring-Summer 2022 the DEA received an unprecedented number of applications (See Q3 2022 Market Overview Report).\\nScrapping the procedure will potentially affect 33 projects totalling almost 20 GW.\\nDevelopers are disappointed and dismayed over the impact to project pipelines, as well as wasted finance on site surveys already underway.\\nAccording to HOFOR, the suspension has impacted multiple projects, with the permitted Aflandshage wind farm (see Q4 2022 Market Overview) under major risk, as delays would adversely affect its route to market.\\nUnplanned policy and legal regime changes have put developer investments at risk, arguably damaging investor trust and investments in the Danish renewable energy generation market.\\nConversely, the impact of the scheme suspension is contradictory to EU policy under the recent Council Regulation on Accelerating Deployment of Renewable Energy, which allows member states special legal powers for speeding up production (see Slide 21).\\nThere needs to be urgent clarity on the future of the scheme from the Ministry.\\nThe government is positive a resolution will be reached with the EU soon while not affecting energy goals.\\nCompetition in government-led auctions is likely to increase as developers previously interested in the open-door scheme will now be vying for the state identified sites, thereby reducing the aggregate potential wind farms in the Danish energy system.\\n*based on assumptions by CREG.\\nAll prices in €/MWh  The scheme has been suspended because of apparent conflicts with the European Union’s competition regulations on State Aid.\\nThe EU maintains laws that ensure there are no distortions to free market dynamics and competition within member states.\\nThe government provision of aid or subsidies is incompatible with the EU common market, unless it meets certain conditions, is necessary for national infrastructure, and has received express EU approval.\\nIt is believed that the ‘open-door’ procedure counted as a government subsidy to promote offshore wind generation but without concession payments from the developer to the state factored in, as they are under the state tendering system.\\nIn addition, previous government communication has highlighted the state’s greater interests and motivations behind promoting renewable energy generation through auction processes: Open door projects were originally smaller and medium-sized, but, in recent years most applications have been for larger projects, farther away from shore.\\nThis has led to challenges for local citizens, legalities and network planning.\\nA drive to promoting market competitiveness, efficiency, and innovation to achieve socio-economic benefits was outlined in the Climate Agreement 2022.\\nThe Minister for Climate, Energy and Supply’s bill presentation in February to the Danish parliament which is seeking to extend government authority in holding state tenders for supporting Power-to-X renewable energy generation, a programme that is also relevant to the open-door scheme.\\nThe Open Door scheme goes against government motivations of deriving economic revenues for the state, through offshore wind permitting and auctions.\\nFeasibility Studies For New Government Tenders Following the Climate Agreement on Green Power and Heat 2022 (see Q3 2022 Market Overview) and Screening of Offshore Wind Locations 2022 (see Q2 2022 Market Overview), the DEA has granted Energinet permission to carry out feasibility studies for three offshore wind areas in Denmark: Hesselø, Kattegat II, and Kriegers Flak II (Danish Kriegers Flak).\\nThe studies will focus on geophysical, geotechnical, and marine biological aspects.\\nResults from these studies will feed into potential developer environmental impact assessments (EIAs), in addition to laying out least risk averse possibilities for wind farm development.\\nThe surveys are being carried out in Q1 2023.\\nThe feasibility studies for Kattegat II and Kriegers Flak II will aid in the final political agreement on the location of offshore wind farms in the two areas.\\nThe tender for Hesselø is expected in Q1 2024 and feasibility studies are likely to be completed in Q4 2024.\\nThe Danish Climate, Energy and Supply Ministry has announced that there are plans underway to tender at least 9 GW of offshore wind energy projects within 2023.\\nThe government is planning to initiate the bidding rounds for Energiø Bornholm and Hesselø in addition to another 5 GW of projects.\\nThe government is also exploring the possibility of including additional offshore wind farms in the previously identified areas in the climate and political agreements from last year.\\nThe 9 GW consists of: 3 GW from Energy Island Bornholm 5 GW from the Finance Act 2022 and Climate Agreement 2022 (see 9 GW TENDERS IN 2023 Kriegers Flak II (Nord and Syd)  Germany: First Tenders with Dynamic Bidding and Qualitative Criteria Launched The first tenders under the new WindSeeG legislation and revised auction mechanism, recently approved under EU law, have been launched.\\nGoing forward, two rounds will run annually based on whether sites have been pre-examined by the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) (see 2022 Market Overviews).\\nThe award criteria and remuneration scheme have been revised, introducing qualitative award criteria, to incentivize for socio-economic and environmental benefits, and uncapped financial bidding which has received criticism – it will increase project financing which could ultimately be passed on to the consumers and/or the wind industry supply chain, driving up LCOE (see Q2 2022 Market Overview).\\nFor a 2 GW non-examined project, each dynamic bidding round could incur and additional € 0 m (see below).\\nHowever, recent auctions in the etherlands with a €50m capped financial bid and site leasing in the US and UK, which yielded record breaking fees imply willingness to incur additional costs in the face of intense competition.\\nTender for Non-Examined Sites with Dynamic The first round, launched end-January, includes 7 GW across three areas in the North Sea and one in the Baltic which have not been centrally pre-examined.\\nBids must be submitted by 1st June (table).\\nDevelopers bid for a market premium offtake with awards based on lowest price in cents/KWh.\\nThe maximum bid price is set at 6.2 cents/ Wh (€ 2/MWh) for auctions in 2023.\\nMost recent auctions have been awarded without subsidy.\\nTo bid, developers must provide signed declarations that at least 20% of the project capacity will be sold via PPAs with one or more companies for at least five years.\\nThe successful bidder has the right to apply to the BSH for planning approval and is entitled to a grid connection.\\nDynamic Bidding for Multiple Zero Subsidy Bids Unlike the proceeding lottery system to determine a winner from multiple zero bids, the government has introduced a dynamic bidding process.\\nUnder it, bidders indicate willingness to pay a second bid component.\\nEligible developers will be invited to participate in bidding rounds with three days’ notice and will be informed of number of participants and bid level.\\nThere is no set timeframe for when the dynamic bidding process will follow the initial bid window.\\nBidding rounds will generally last 60 minutes and at least 30 minutes and can be carried out for several areas simultaneously.\\nGenerally, the first bidding round is set at €30,000/MW.\\nIn the event only two bidders submit zero subsidy bids then the first bidding round is reduced to € 5,000/MW.\\nBidders can progress to the next round, provided they match the bid level.\\nBid levels will increase by €30,000/MW increments, providing all bidders submitted bids at the specified bid level.\\nOtherwise, the incremental increase is reduced to € 5,000/MW.\\nDynamic bidding is carried out until only one bidder agrees to the bid level.\\nIf no bidder agrees to the bid level, it will be awarded to the highest bidder below the bid level.\\nIf there are multiple equal bids below the bidding bevel or no bids within a round, a winner may be decided by lottery.\\n90% of the second bid component payment goes towards the TSO, 5% to the federal budget for marine conservation, and 5% to federal budget for fisheries.\\n*Step-in-rights exercised four-weeks post-auction award.\\nPre-examined Tenders with qualitative criteria The Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) launched a further 1.8 GW worth of tenders for offshore wind energy on 27th February for pre- examined sites (table, previous slide).\\nThe bid deadline is 1st August, with results four months later.\\nDevelopers must submit a financial bid value in euros and a project description, which must contain information on four other qualitative criteria (table).\\nIf multiple bids receive the same number of points, the highest financial bid wins.\\nIf multiple bidders submit the same price, they will be invited to raise it.\\nThe government has clarified and amended the contribution to decarbonization following consultation.\\nIt is limited to large components of foundations, connecting pieces, towers and turbines, with the rotor blades, generator, gearbox, shaft, and frame each being independent components.\\nThe manufacture of fixtures and fittings (e.g.\\ncabinets, ladders, and railings) is not included.\\nThe government has also removed requirements to calculate the proportion of renewables based on expected amounts of energy needed, i.e.\\nno longer based on specific amounts of energy, because it is considered too early in the project lifecycle to do so and difficult to have final certainty about the supply chain.\\nThe requirement for manufacturers to demonstrate share of renewables is also removed, instead it is expected for developers to ensure that manufacturers are contractually obliged to use a proportion of renewable energy.\\nWindSeeG states that the contribution to decarbonization should ultimately be achieved via the proportion of green hydrogen used in turbine manufacturing, but this is pending separate hydrogen regulation coming into force at a later date.\\nA security deposit is determined from the bid amount multiplied by € 00/kW for non-examined sites and €200/kW for pre-examined sites.\\n25% of the security deposit is due by the bid deadline.\\nThe remaining 75% is due within three months of the award.\\nThe difference in deposit between examined and non-examined tenders likely reflects the increased risk for the latter due to less site data available prior to tender and additional expense to the developer to conduct site investigations.\\nUp to 00% of the security deposit will be retained if developer’s fail to meet set milestones (Blue Box) set by the WindSeeG.\\nBNetzA can also revoke the auction award if 1, 2 or 5 are not met.\\nThe area may then be put out to tender again.\\nThere are exceptions if developers fail to meet deadlines through no fault of their own.\\nIf planning applications deviate from the conditions agreed as part of the winning bid, particularly the qualitative criteria committed to for non-examined sites, the BSH can refuse approval and 100% of the security deposit is retained.\\nDevelopers can return the auction award or planning approvals prior to Milestone 2 if: it is determined during investigations/approvals that the economic or technical feasibility is impaired; or there are legal or environmental causes which cannot be feasibly and affordably adapted to; or errors are found in the BSH’s preliminary investigation results which make the project unfeasible.\\nThe highest bid receives maximum points.\\nThere is no cap.\\nPoints awarded to lower bids are calculated proportionally.\\n90% of the bid component payment goes towards the TSO to achieve electricity cost reduction.\\nThis is paid on an annual basis over 20 years.\\n5% to the federal budget for marine conservation and 5% to federal budget for fisheries.\\nThis is paid, within 12 months of contract award, to the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection and the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture.\\nBidders must state the proportion of unsubsidized renewable electricity in the total electricity requirement that they will ensure in future production of the turbines.\\nThe manufacturing process includes the process from the delivery of raw materials through to the completion of turbine components ready for transport for the larger components.\\nDeclarations from manufacturers are no longer needed but developers must prove afterwards that targeted renewable share has been met.\\nMaximum points awarded to the bidder with the highest proportion of renewable energy and points awarded to lower bids proportionally.\\nEnergy generated in GWh.\\nBids may not exceed the areas’ total possible electricity generation, which will be provided in advance.\\nMaximum points will be awarded to those which match maximum possible generation.\\nMaximum points will be awarded to the bid with the highest number of turbines (as a percentage of the total) that do not use pile hammering or gravity based solutions.\\nThe percentage of employees, subject to social security contributions, throughout development, construction, and maintenance.\\nThe highest bid will receive maximum points.\\n1.\\nPlanning applications must be submitted to the BSH within 12 months (pre-examined) or 24 months (non-examined) of tender award (100% security required if violated).\\nPlanning approval is valid for 25 years (+10-year extension).\\n2.\\nProof of financing must be available at least two months after the completion date becomes binding (100% security required if violated).\\n3.\\nConstruction of turbines must have started six months before completion date (70% security required if violated).\\n4.\\nAt least one turbine and its array cables must be operational by the completion date (one twelfth of remaining security deposit required for every month of delay required if violated).\\n5.\\n95% of capacity must be operational within six months of the completion date (remaining security deposit multiplied by capacity of turbines not yet installed and awarded bid amount required if violated).\\nThe BSH has published the new Area Development Plan (FEP) for the expansion of offshore wind It confirms sites, tender and commissioning schedule, and grid connections to achieve at least 30 GW by 2030, and lays the foundations for 50GW by 2035, exceeding the 40 GW expansion target under WindSeeG Law by 10 GW .\\n24.7 GW has been identified across planned tenders, yielding 36.5 GW of cumulative capacity to be built early-mid 2030’s, including the newly defined area N-21.1 and significant expansion of the BalWin and LanWin clusters (N-9 to N-13) with average project sizes of 2 GW.\\nA test field for the promotion of research and development in coastal waters has also been defined, as well as an enlarged site for up to 1 GW electroloysis (see Q3 & Q4 2022 Market Overviews).\\nTo meet 50 GW by 2035, the next FEP (work commencing this spring) will include additional non-examined tender areas for 2025, 2026, and 2027.\\nFor 2028 to 2030, specifications are planned for an annual volume of 4 GW, half of which should be subject to central preliminary investigations and half to be put out to tender without a central preliminary investigation (chart).\\nN-23, N-24, and N-25 will likely be tendered first (map).\\nHowever, this is contingent on sufficient grid expansion and acceleration of permitting procedures (blue box).\\nLong-Term Vision for 70 GW by 2045 Additional areas for 8-10 GW are expected within the shipping route SN10 in the North Sea EEZ.\\nThe German Marine Spatial Plan (ROP 2021) defined the shipping route as limited priority area for shipping until end-2035 and dependent on traffic control measures in coordination with Netherlands and Denmark.\\nThis examination is nearing completion.\\nAreas N-4 and N-5 are under review for reuse and will also be discussed.\\nHowever, as existing sites and grid connections are prepared for reuse, new sites will be needed to compensate for power loss, hence at least 78 GW will be required to achieve expansion targets, according to the BSH.\\nIt is likely that at least 16 additional connection systems will be required to meet 70 GW targets.\\nIn order to manage these connection systems on land, further border corridor capacities to the territorial sea must be defined.\\nThe first draft of the Network Development Plan (NEP) 2037/2045 is expected end-Q1 2023.\\nThe German Federal Cabinet has approved amendments to accelerate permitting for renewables and power grids, in line with new EU directive 2022/2577.\\nThis has been introduced on the grounds that renewable energy projects are considered to be of overriding public interest and can help ensure energy security during the ongoing energy crisis.\\nFor offshore wind, the new EU regulation means: EIAs and species protection assessments are waived for renewable energy, energy storage, and necessary grid expansion projects, which have undergone strategic environmental assessment for national plans.\\nOmitting EIAs could reduce permitting timeframes by approx.\\none year.\\nInstead of the species protection assessment, precautions should be taken to reduce the possible negative impact on animal species via mitigation measures and/or compensation payments.\\nRepowering projects will be permitted within six months (three months if the change in capacity is <15%).\\nThe EIA is limited to a delta EIA, i.e.\\nto the additional impact compared to original project.\\nIn Germany, this policy has been implemented through amendments to the Regional Planning Act which will apply to ongoing and future projects to Mid- 2024.\\nAdditionally, Germany requires the use of bubble curtains during installation and after two years offshore wind projects are subjected to a ‘special’ species protection assessment as part of a monitoring program and where necessary additional mitigation measures will be required or a financial compensation for national species protection.\\nAnnual payments are due to the federal government in the range of €500-2,500/MW and €50,000/km of cable.\\n20% of funds can be used for research into impacts of offshore wind.\\nFor a 2 GW wind farm, this could equate to € 25m over a 25-year lifetime.\\nThe BWO has criticised this as adding additional financial risks to investors, coupled with uncapped financial bidding in tenders, could have negative impact on LCOE.\\nIt is also unclear which appropriate mitigation measures are included; the BWO advocates that alternative technologies to bubble curtains are also considered.\\nGermany: Area Development Plan Sets Out 50 GW by 2035 36.8 GW tenders needed to meet 50 GW by 2035 Capacity to be tendered by type, based on FEP schedule.\\nN h la ds: D v l p s Bid € m i HK T d In December, Ecowende (Shell and Eneco) won the subsidy free tender for the 756 MW Hollandse Kust West VI site (map).\\nIn a highly competitive round, 28 of 49 applications met the initial criteria.\\nThe cap for the financial bid component was set at €50 m (which was met) which, combined with studies and environmental impact assessments, means the state will be paid a total of € 3.5 m. In assessing the applications, maintenance of the local ecosystem, environment, and biodiversity of the North Sea was given significant consideration (see Q4 2021 and 2022 Market Overviews).\\nEcowende will carry out 40 experiments and aim to support seabed reef structures and flight of birds between turbines, as well as innovating pile driving techniques to minimize underwater impact.\\nThe Hollandse Kust West VII was awarded in December 2022 to Oranje Wind Power II (RWE; see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nThe deciding factor was innovation for integration with the Danish energy network.\\nRWE proposed plans for 600 MW of onshore electrolysers (producing green hydrogen), 225 MW of e-boilers for district heating and industrial applications, batteries, and floating offshore solar energy.\\nThe Hollandse Kust West VI and VII tenders are the first such Dutch licensing rounds, structured as comparative tests with financial bids.\\nIt has shown that non-financial and qualitative features are increasingly being given more importance among assessment criteria to maximise socio-economic and environmental benefits and revenue for the State.\\nPrioritising qualitative assessment over price criteria indicates competition is shifting from just cost reduction incentives, i.e.\\nlargest turbines to achieve lowest LCOE.\\nWillingness to pay additional financial bid components also indicates the high level of competition amongst Developers.\\nBoth sites are due to be commissioned in 2026.\\nFollowing the success of the Hollandse Kust tenders, the Ministry of Climate and Energy Policy will give high consideration to qualitative non- price features in the upcoming Ijmuiden Ver tenders.\\nOther assessment criteria include: plans for system integration, international corporate social responsibility, sustainable supply of raw materials, and circularity.\\nAll 4 GW of Ijmuiden Ver I to IV will be licensed in one tender round, to be launched in Q4 2023.\\nIn February, the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) published site characterization details from a range of geophysical and geotechnical studies that will help developers plan their applications.\\nIn December, the government updated the Offshore Wind Energy Roadmap 2030 (see 2022 Market Overviews).\\nIt indicates that tendering for Ten Noorden van de Waddeneilanden and Hollandse Kust West VIII is expected in 2026/27.\\nOn government direction, National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) has reviewed the consenting procedure for offshore wind farms, as Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs).\\nThe process has been significantly slow.\\nEnergy Security Strategy 2022 proposed application decision timeframes should be one year, however, some projects have taken up to four years, overall seeing a 65% rise in timespans.\\nEnergy security and net zero targets have motivated the government to publish a policy paper for reforming the consenting system.\\nThis will feed into a new National Policy Statement on water infrastructure later in 2023 as part of a reform programme.\\nReform programme aims for streamlining the process: 1.\\nStrategic direction for infrastructure planning, to enable swifter decision-making.\\n2.\\nFaster consenting process through operational changes, stricter timescales and fast-tracked applications.\\n3.\\nBetter environmental protection.\\n4.\\nImproved local community engagement.\\n5.\\nSustainable consenting system to facilitate a more robust regime.\\nNote: Further insight into the proposed policy will be provided in subsequent market overview reports.\\nFinalisation of regulatory regime for action plan More improvements: digital and flexible Planning Inspectorate, new Environmental Outcome Reports and Oranje Wind Power II (RWE)  United Kingdom: Northern Ireland Plans 1 GW orthern Ireland’s epartment for the Economy (DfE) and TCE have signed a statement of intent to work towards establishing 1 GW of offshore wind by 2030.\\nThe statement of intent summarises the leasing plan for Northern Irish waters.\\nIt also outlines policies around marine areas, transmission networks, ecosystem resilience, revenue support, and governance devolution that need to be streamlined.\\nThis follows the 2022 Energy Strategy Action Plan, which includes a roadmap to reduce energy-related carbon emissions by 56% by 2030.\\nOffshore wind has been given priority in the support scheme for enabling renewable energy technologies.\\nThe DfE has also launched a consultation to establish design characteristics for a renewable energy support scheme.\\nThe government is currently in the ‘scoping phase’ of evaluating what a future renewable energy subsidy scheme would look like.\\nThe main aims for the scheme would be to create increased competition, establish investor confidence, fulfil net-zero goals, ensure consumer protection, and interface the British and Irish energy markets.\\nAccording to DfE-commissioned analysis, the Northern Irish government must find the right balance between British and Irish approaches; the former is decreasing its subsidies timeline to benefit consumers while the latter is extending subsidies to encourage investment.\\nDuring the consultation phase, the following factors would have to be given prime consideration to help establish the subsidy regime created by orthern Ireland’s DfE: Consumer protection, through repayment from generators to ensure the cost of energy is feasible for the public.\\nSustainability & net zero, to ensure renewable technologies prioritized to achieve the 2030 80% renewable energy target.\\nEnergy diversity, to realize a mix of energy technologies through subsidy auction parameters for multiple varied technology pots.\\nFunding mechanism, as this will impact investor confidence and consumer costs in relation to tax design of the scheme.\\nAgreement length, as this will affect consumer costs and investor competition; likely to be set at 15 years.\\nAllocation process and contract structure, as this will influence subsidy payment mechanism, investor interest, competitiveness, consumer costs and price certainty.\\nTwo-way contracts for difference have been identified as being ideal.\\nPrice sources (i.e.\\nprice certainty) and timing of the subsidy, as these will impact investor confidence, competition and scheme interest.\\nAn annual subsidy regime and investor price bidding relative to market price is being suggested.\\nTechnologies and their treatment (i.e pot structuring), as this will enable varied decision-making on bids, promote of a generation mix, improve scheme competition and allow for immediate focus on mature technologies.\\nInput control and market flexibility, to enable the scheme to grow as the energy market progresses and ensuring energy security through subsidy floors and ceilings.\\nCapacity requirements, as the scale of generators eligible in the scheme will affect competitiveness and consumer costs.\\nA dedicated subsidy designed for local and small generators is being recommended to promote multiple investment levels.\\nThe Autumn Statement introduced a 45% ‘Electricity Generator Levy’ for exceptional profits from low-carbon generation (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nA technical note in December updated it: The generation threshold has been lowered from 100 GW/year to 50 GW/year, making tax more broadly applicable.\\nThe £ 5/MWh (€ 4.\\n/MWh) benchmark price will be indexed in line with CPI.\\nIn real terms, the levy will increase with time, so will also affect the number of generators falling under the tax net.\\nSome costs, e.g.\\nfuel and revenue sharing arrangements, will be considered allowed deductibles, with a scope to expand the list in the future.\\nThe technical note includes more information on defining groups and joint ventures, along with special rules for joint ventures that take into account shares owned, the sale of electricity, and associated taxes.\\nIt also clarifies that the levy will not apply to imported electricity and energy under private network agreements.\\nThe final version is expected in the spring Finance Bill, although the tax is in effect from January 2023 to April 2028.\\nThere are six R4 projects: Dogger Bank South West, Dogger Bank South East, Outer Dowsing, Morgan, Mona, and Morecambe.\\nAll have signed ten-year agreements for lease with the Crown Estate (TCE).\\nBetween them, they will pay TCE approximately £1 bn (€ .\\nbn) per year as option payments.\\nOption fees last at least three years, when they reduce and transition to rent payments if the project progresses to lease.\\nA consultation for AR6 (scheduled for 2024) closed in March.\\nProposed Private wire offshore oil and gas facilities to become ineligible for CfDs.\\nAmending the definition of floating offshore wind to factor in innovation.\\nMaking offshore wind farms connected to multi-purpose interconnectors eligible for CfDs.\\nMaintaining the phasing policy for fixed-bottom offshore wind projects.\\nClarifying the relationship between the CfD scheme and the capacity mechanism.\\nClarifying whether the CfD can effectively support repowered projects.\\nUnited Kingdom: Contracts for Difference Allocation Rounds Update The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has released the draft allocation framework and core parameters for Allocation Round 5 (AR5) of the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme.\\nThe budget notice is expected in March.\\nThe draft AR5 framework differs slightly from AR4: AR5 is the first annual auction, hence timelines are more streamlined.\\nWhile the dates published are provisional, it is more likely that they will be adhered to.\\nFloating offshore wind projects must provide supply chain statements (similar to other technologies) and the qualifying pass mark for these projects is at 50% as compared to 60% for other technologies.\\nPrivate network generators have been more clearly defined as generators that are exempt from requiring electricity generation licenses and generate electricity for specifically supplying a private network.\\nA director declaration is required to establish eligibility.\\nFeedback sessions are now included in the qualification assessment process.\\nCore Parameters & Strike Prices Offshore wind is now in Pot 1, so will be grouped with other mature technologies such as energy from waste with CHP, hydro (>5 MW and <50 MW), landfill gas, onshore wind (>5 MW), remote island wind (>5 MW), sewage gas, and solar PV (>5 MW) Delivery years for Pot 1 are: 2025/26, 2026/27, The strike price for offshore wind has been set at £44/MWh (€4 .\\n/MWh; in 20 2 prices).\\nThe strike price has been calculated using project costs and technology supply curves.\\nProject costs are based on assumptions used from planning consents using a range of estimates such as project capacities, CAPEX, load factors, Transmission Network Use of System charges, and decommissioning costs.\\nTrends show that administrative strikes prices are going down steadily (chart, below).\\nThis may impact the level of de-risking and incentives to developers.\\nThe price differential between strike prices from one round to the next is decreasing as well.\\nHowever, returns must be assessed alongside the variation of market price for offshore wind energy.\\nThe CfD programme lays out administrative strike prices and clearing prices using 2012 as the base year, hence, their calculations for prices are done using the 2012 UK Consumer Price Index (CPI).\\nHowever, when weighted according to 2023 indices, the values of these prices decrease as the purchasing power parity of each specific price point has depreciated.\\nThis means that a 2012 weighted price point now has lower value in terms of 2023 prices, as the same price would now have less purchasing power than in 2012.\\nIt is important to consider clearing prices in reference to 2023 indices, as investors will be paying for raw materials and services in the supply chain according to recent prices instead of 2012 prices.\\nFurthermore, in utilizing the CPI, the CfD scheme is evaluating prices with the consumer in mind, however, for investors and their CAPEX calculations for Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), producer prices are more relevant for the supply chain.\\nThis is a key consideration as the values of the CPI are different when compared to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for the same period, resulting in a greater variation and decreased values, as compared to the 2012 clearing prices.\\nTherefore, if 2012 clearing prices that are based on the CPI are compared to PPI indexed prices for 2023, the difference is significant.\\nThus, arguably the PPI is a better index to peg prices against than the CPI, when investors are modelling LCOE.\\nHowever, to give greater weightage to increasing labour and services costs as a result of inflation, factoring in the Services Producer Price Index (SSPI) would be an effective approach as compared to using the PPI alone.\\nAs an index, SPPI values sit between the CPI and the PPI, so it may balance the differential.\\nDiminishing Allocation Round Strike Price Administrative Strike

(pots, caps etc.)\\nEstonia: Tenders Open to the Public Last year, the Estonian maritime spatial plan was completed and some areas were dedicated for offshore wind development (see Q2 2022 Market Overview).\\nThese areas will be divided into three to four parts and put up for auction in September.\\nWinners of the auction will play a key role in Estonia’s energy future.\\n44 construction permit applications have been submitted for an area covering nearly 1,800 km2 south and west of Saaremaa.\\nMultiple developers showed interest in the same areas, the competition to develop offshore wind in Estonia is going to make the upcoming auction important to keep an eye on.\\nInterested developers include but are not limited to RWE Renewables, Sunly Wind, Eolus, TotalEnergies Renewables, and Utilitas Wind.\\nConstruction permits will be awarded at auction to the candidates paying the most.\\nThe auction’s starting bidding price is € 5,000/km2.\\nBy the first week of March, the competition requirements and sites will be announced.\\nNetwork operators have the right to charge a fee of €3 ,000/MW in a year if the reserved power network resource is not used.\\nevelopers must pay a deposit of €3 ,000/MW upon entering a contract to connect to the network.\\nIf the offshore wind farms are connected within three years, the deposit will be returned.\\nAll 44 applications submitted so far are preliminary and have no legal weight.\\nTherefore, all interested parties will have to submit additional applications from March, with an application submission window of 60 days.\\nThe Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority (TTJA) will announce the bidders in July, and, after qualification, the auctions can start.\\nThe three auctioning methods proposed are: ▪ Silent auctions: written bids which are not public.\\n▪ Live auctions: bids expressed verbally i.e.\\ntransparent bidding.\\n▪ Online auctions: online transparent bidding.\\nThe first auction will take place towards the beginning of September, with further auctions between October and November.\\nSubsequent auctions will depend on how successful the first one is.\\nThe Estonian grid cannot support the capacities proposed by offshore wind farms.\\nProjects that are ready to connect to the gird faster will have a better chance to be accepted and given an option to connect.\\nThe Estonian grid has a problem with phantom connections; phantom connections are grid connection points where production has stopped or network capacity has been deliberately seized to do or not do something else with it.\\nTo accelerate renewable energy development in Estonia, Amendments to the Electricity Market Act are currently being discussed in the parliament and were sent to the president’s office for a response in Q1 2023.\\nWithin the marine area plan but outside of auctions, Estonia and Latvia are planning a joint ELWIND wind farm west of Sõrve.\\nAccording to ministry plans, the state will develop the area until a building permit is NOT ALL AREAS ARE AUCTIONED AT THE SAME TIME have to set up the wind turbines.\\nsource: ELWIND.\\nFinland: Green Hub Plans in Åland OX2 and Ålandsbanken Fondbolag (the Bank of Åland’s fund management subsidiary) have initiated a feasibility study for the planning and establishment of a ‘Mega Grön Hamn’ (‘mega green port’) near the Port of Långnäs in Åland.\\nThe project will serve as a key part of the offshore wind development in Åland, assisting in construction logistics for individual wind power projects.\\nThe feasibility study will focus on practical, technical, and financial factors.\\nThe study will last for 12 months, creating a better understanding of the conditions around the proposed area.\\nThe green hub is a positive indication for offshore wind development in Finland; more infrastructure to support the offshore wind development is being built indicating the level of commitment and efforts by investors in an emerging market with high potential.\\nFirst Major Offshore Wind Project in Finland In December, a partnership was established between Vattenfall (75%) and Metsähallitus (25%) for the development and construction of the 1.3 GW Korsnas offshore wind farm, located on the west coast.\\nThe project is planned to be operational around 2030.\\nHowever, Metsähallitus cannot generate power by law so Vattenfall will have 100% shares by the end of the permitting phase, when construction starts.\\nMetsähallitus is the body responsible for Finland's state-owned land and water and will be leasing the seabed area to Vattenfall during construction and operation phase.\\nThe project will not have any subsidies and will be exposed to market prices.\\nRevenue will likely be secured via commercial PPAs.\\nThe entire cost of the project including the cost of building the grid connection infrastructure will be the responsibility of Vattenfall.\\nFinland’s public water area has an offshore potential of GW and is planned to be auctioned on commercial terms, the number of sites to be chosen for development will depend on supply and demand by the electricity markets, electricity transmission capacity in the grid, and the interest of the local municipalities.\\nCurrently, EIA scoping and site surveys are underway.\\nThe first nature surveys started in Spring 2021.\\nSite assessments and permitting will take around three years and are planned to conclude by 2025-2026.\\nAfter the required surveys are done, the project will have to progress ▪ Wind measurements (2 years).\\n▪ Environmental impact assessment (EIA); 2 years).\\n▪ Opinion from defence forces.\\n▪ Preliminary negotiations with the transmission system operator (TSO) to find solutions for transmitting electricity to the national grid.\\n▪ Final negotiations with the TSO to connect the wind farm to the national grid.\\n▪ Applying for a water permit.\\n▪ Applying for an obstacle clearance in accordance with aviation act.\\n▪ Construction permit.\\n▪ Acquisition of power plants.\\n▪ Starting construction.\\n▪ Operational phase.\\nIn January, Greece revised the National Energy and Climate Plan ( ECP), under the EU’s ‘Fit for 55’ goal, which targets a 55% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030.\\nAdditionally, it aims for 80% renewables by 2030.\\nGreece is now targeting 28 GW of renewables by 2030, up from 19 GW proposed in the NECP of 2019.\\nGreece has also raised its offshore wind target from 2 GW to 2.7 GW by 2030, representing a 35% increase.\\nGreece is targeting 7 GW of onshore wind capacity, having already achieved 4.7 GW in 2022.\\nThe offshore wind target has been raised to 2.7 GW Targeted capacity (GW) for renewables in Greece by 2030, 2023 NECP vs 2019 NECP.\\nThe blue represents new targets, while the orange represents old targets.\\nAt the end of 2022, the Greek government issued two designations.\\nThe first was from the Coordination Committee for the connection and development of offshore wind projects, which is significant for future designation of zones, and the second was the Bank Guarantee Letter template for the Exploration Licence.\\nThe Exploration Licence, the first of which are expected to be awarded in 2024, will allow potential developers to conduct site surveys in a specific OWFODA to start project development if or when they eventually bid in the auction for that specific site.\\nThe Bank Guarantee Letter template for this license is a necessary first step in creating the legal procedure for future authorization.\\nThis shows that the country is earnest in its design of a lease and subsidy system to support future offshore wind development.\\nH1: National Offshore Wind Development Programme begins after the finalization of the strategic environmental impact assessment (SEIA) and issuance of the Joint Ministerial Decision (JMD) approving the programme.\\nH2: Submission of technical studies for the determination of Offshore Wind Farms Organized Development Areas (OWFODA) and installation areas within them; grid connection proposals for projects with the Hellenic Electricity Transmission System (HETS).\\nH2: Submission of SEIA for each technical study for the OWFODA designations.\\nThe Hellenic Hydrocarbons and Energy Resources Management Company (HEREMA) is in charge of designating OWFODA.\\nDesignation of OWFODA is expected in H1 2024.\\nThe OWFODA process has two tenders: 1.\\nTenders for Exploration Licences within OWFODA (Articles 69 and 70 in Law 4962/2022, the Offshore Wind Legislative Framework approved in mid-2022).\\nThis step is currently planned for 2024.\\n2.\\nCompetitive tenders (auctions) for the selection of investors that will develop OWF projects within OWFODA (Article 72) will occur in 2026 at the earliest.\\nTwo months following the designation of OWFODA and a Presidential Decree, HEREMA will announce the deadline for applications for Exploration Licences within OWFODA.\\nApplicants will be able to apply for Exploration Licences in multiple OWFODAs.\\nApplicants must be established in an EU Member State or have entered into multilateral or bilateral international agreements with the EU in the renewable energy sector.\\nAll eligible applications will be evaluated by HEREMA based on criteria evaluating professional, technical, and financial competence.\\nIf the applicant satisfies all criteria, HEREMA will issue the Exploration Licence within thirty days of the application being submitted.\\nThe Licence will be valid for three years unless revoked.\\nReceipt of an Exploration Licence will require a letter of guarantee (€ 0,000/MW).\\nWithin two years of the end of the first Exploration Licence tenders, HEREMA will launch a public consultation to determine installation areas within OWFODA, which will then be decided by Ministerial Decision (MD).\\nFour months after the MD, auctions will be launched by the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE).\\n4C expects that offshore wind tenders – for site and subsidy award – will begin in 2026/27 at the earliest, based on the policy timeline put forth by the Greek government in 2022 and based on the progress to date in kick starting development (the approval of the offshore wind framework in July 2022 and the issuance of the two designations at end-2022).\\n4C has low confidence in Greece achieving 2.7 GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030 and instead estimates a modest 300 MW.\\nHowever, this may increase in the future given the country’s political progress and commitment to floating wind.\\nThe country will face initial challenges from its limited supply chain and lack of installed offshore wind, but with good planning and necessary investment to develop the country’s infrastructure (ports, shipyards, etc.)\\nand supply chain, Greece may achieve multiple GW by 2040.\\nIssuance of a Joint Ministerial corresponding SEIA for Greece.\\nPresidential Decree).\\nCriteria

Consent (MAC).\\nThese 45-year exclusivity agreements, awarded in 2022, require sites to obtain a route to market by end-2025).\\nThe project design must be in line with details of the MAC, GCA, or planning consent application (if made).\\nDevelopers may not propose mutually exclusive or co-dependant project bids.\\nevelopers must post a bid bond of € /MWh (€23.\\nk/MW) 1.\\nAssuming sufficient successful applicants, The TSO will determine an (as-yet undecided) Final Competition Ratio (FCR), establishing the inclusive cap for the auction.\\nAn FCR of 2 means the cap is set at 50% of the competing volume.\\nNote: in the UK, BEIS uses a process that results in an FCR of ~4 (25% of project supply is expected to be successful).\\nThe FCR and other auctions parameters will be published in an Auction Information Pack (due mid-May).\\n2.\\nApplicants submit a sealed-bid offer price (€/MWh), deemed the ‘strike price’ if successful, for an offer quantity (MW) which is not greater than its grid agreement (the Maximum Entry Capacity in the project’s GCA).\\nThis is then converted into a Deemed Energy Quantity (DEQ), using a Capacity Factor of 45%.\\n3.\\nWinners are selected from low to high price until the cap is breached.\\nWhere projects have equal prices, the largest project wins.\\nAs the cap is inclusive, the breaching project is also a winner.\\nWinners are pay- as-bid, not

unsuccessful in ORESS-1 whose grid capacity is no longer available will not be eligible to compete in ORESS-2.\\n4C understands this problem to be most notable in Zone G, north of Dublin, where NISA and Oriel wish to connect.\\nFor this Phase 1 auction, CRU has taken a minded-to position that the developer builds the transmission assets, which are then transferred to EirGrid 18-months post-energization.\\nThe developer will be paid an Asset Transfer Contribution (ATC) of 70% of the estimate CAPEX, to be agreed prior to O-RESS 1, with additional costs to be recovered via O-RESS.\\nExclusively the six relevant projects recently awarded MACs and GCAs (see ‘ORESS Qualification’).\\nunder Phase 1 plus qualifying projects in development.\\n~2.5 GW by 2030 plus Designated

project attributes, allowing for a score out of 100.\\nThe highest scoring projects are considered the cheapest to develop and thus assumed to bid the lowest: Park Size (MW): 30%, Wind Speed (20%), Distance to OM Port (20%), Grid Route Length (15%) and Depth (15%) The Total Energy Available across all projects is 17,640 GWh (sum of annual project production assuming 45% capacity factor).\\nAssuming a Final Competition Ratio (FCR) of 2, the auction cap would be set at 17,640/2 = 8,820 GWh.\\nThree scenarios can be considered: Scenario 1: Ranking the projects according to their score it can be seen that Arklow Bank wins, Codling comes second and just tips through the cap, thereby closing the auction with 2,250 MW awarded.\\nScenario 2: Maximum MW.\\nIn this scenario, the largest project, Codling, is again the cap-breaker, but only after Dublin Array makes it through, resulting in more capacity allocated than under Scenario 1.\\nScenario 3: Split Dublin Array: It is understood that ublin Array’s ish & Bray will have to bid separately.\\nIf so, the developer risks only one project going through whilst also perhaps bidding with a joint price in mind to take advantage of scale economies.\\nImportant: the auction outcome is highly sensitive to FCR, meaning these scenarios should be considered illustrative until FCR is confirmed in the Spring.\\n2 x OHVS->2

with the passing of the Ministerial Decree of 30th December 2022, which updated the regulation of the methods for the payment of fees concerning preliminary investigation activities carried out by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE), as opposed to the Ministry of Economic Development (MISE) in the past.\\nFor renewable projects with a capacity of 300 MW or more or whose value is greater than €5 m, a payment of 0.1% of the value of the work to be carried out is charged to the applicants upon submission of application, in the cases of preliminary investigations conducted by the General Directorate of Infrastructures and Security of MASE for the authorization of energy plants and infrastructure (issuance of permits, concessions, or other approvals).\\nSince 2019, when the FER 1 decree elapsed, the government has repeatedly promised fast and streamlined approvals as well as incentives for offshore wind and the other renewables excluded from the FER 1.\\nOnce the FER 2 decree is issued, Italy can begin tenders for between 3.5 and 5 GW of floating wind farms in total, with a goal of installation by 2030.\\n4C estimates that as much as 1 GW of floating wind may begin installation by 2030 in Italy.\\nThe earliest the decree may be issued is in mid-March, but due to its delay over the past few years, it may be late again.\\nIf tenders begin in H2 2023, they are expected to last until 2027, with 750 MW to 1 GW tendered each year (depending on the GW by 2030 target chosen).\\nThe 5 GW by 2030 target is likely to be decreased, potentially back down to 3.5 GW as proposed in earlier drafts.\\nIf auctions are again delayed, this could impact Italy’s capacity of installed offshore wind by 2030, and lead to missed national and EU targets regarding offshore wind.\\nIt is important to finalize the FER 2 promptly, as the EU has set a deadline for all member states to update their National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs) by end-June 2023.\\nThe plans are meant to be updated approximately every two years, so that the European Commission may monitor the EU’s progress towards achieving its individual and collective goals for the energy transition and reaching net- ero by 2050.\\nItaly’s new NREAP will differ vastly from the previous one, submitted in 2020, which proposed a target of 900 MW of offshore wind by 2030.\\nIn 2023, Italy will also update its National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza, PNRR/NRRP).\\nThe Italian government hopes to speed up reforms to simplify authorization procedures relating to renewable energy plants.\\nAs of publication, the government is still drafting the revised plan.\\nIn the draft, Article 72 introduces the simplified authorization.\\nConstruction and commissioning of offshore renewable projects will be subject to a simplified permit process that includes the EIA and will be necessary for the issuance of the maritime concession.\\nLithuania: First Offshore Wind Tender Litgrid, the Lithuanian TSO, announced pre-connection conditions for offshore wind farms after the report had been prepared.\\nWe are still awaiting ERT’s auction requirements in full.\\nThis will be highlighted in the webinar and expanded on in the next issue of the Market Overview Report.\\nLithuania is going through a crucial time in offshore wind development.\\nThe upcoming first offshore wind auction granting a development and operation permit is planned for Q3 2023.\\nThis is the first step for developers to enter the offshore wind market in Lithuania.\\nThe winner will be

up to 180 days from publication of tender materials.\\nThe registration window 90 days from that publication date.\\nThe regulator determines the winner of the tender within 60 days of the registration deadline.\\nThis term can be extended by 30 days at the tender committee’s discretion.\\nThe duration of the generation permit is 35 years without the possibility of extension, awarded to the winner of the first tender.\\nThe over all permit duration is 41 years including 6 years for development.\\nQ : Package of laws on OSW development in the Q4: Government approves criteria for par

The auction winner will be required to reimburse the costs of studies for the area done by the tender organizer.\\nThe development fee must be paid within five years of the electricity permit’s issuance.\\nThe development fee will have to be paid annually in equal amounts.\\nThe first offshore wind farm in Lithuania will connect to the 330 kV arbėnai switchyard owned by Litgrid.\\nInfrastructure studies to evaluate the technological and technical parameters will be carried out in the Q2 2023.\\nThe arbėnai substation is scheduled for completion in 2025.\\nThe developer of the offshore wind farm will be responsible for financing the implementation of the development of the switchyard.\\nDevelopers have some concerns regarding cables physically overlapping between the locations of the arbėnai substation and the Harmony Link interconnector.\\nHarmony Link is a new Lithuanian-Polish project that will connect the Zarnowiec substation in the Pomeranian region of Poland with the arbėnai substation in the Kretinga region of Lithuania.\\nThe key component of the interconnector is a 700 MW HVDC cable.\\nThe power link will be about 330 km long, of which about 290 km will be the offshore part.\\nDashed lines in the figure refer to grid connection infrastructure to be developed.\\nNorway: First Tender Launch Nearly Due The Norwegian government is set to launch its first offshore wind tender by end-March.\\nThe tender terms were under public consultation in December and January.\\nThey concern two areas that were opened for offshore wind development in 2020: Image: Sørlige Nordsjø II, via the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.\\nScope: 1.4-1.5 GW bottom-fixed offshore wind connected to shore radially.\\nDespite the maximum of 1.5 GW, only 1.4 GW (considered the minimum by the ministry) can be connected to land because of the limit for dimensioning errors in the transmission network.\\nAt this point, only one of three 1.5 GW areas of Sørlige Nordsjø II is being offered.\\nIt is 605 km2 and assuming an area efficiency of 5 MW/km2, the ministry suggests that 50% can be utilized for a project.\\nThe ministry needs to clarify the offshore grid framework before the announcement date.\\nSupport: The ministry is proposing an allocation model that works both with and without support.\\nIt reasons that fixed technology is mature enough to progress without state aid.\\nPossible support mechanisms Investment support – a cash payment at the time of investment.\\nBilateral contract for difference (CfD) with a short reference period (hour) or a long period (month or year) – a long-term agreement with a strike price, where the state takes the profit if power is higher and pays the difference if it is lower.\\nFeedback on proposals generally favoured the CfD, which is the government’s preferred approach (after subsidy-free).\\nIn this case, the ministry is ordering a ceiling price for the government’s contribution, but no such cap should be set for the developer’s contribution.\\nProcess: This area will be awarded by auction, including prequalification, but neither the limit nor the prequalification criteria have yet been specified.\\nThe auction will be purely monetary – i.e.\\nlowest contract price wins.\\nIt may follow a hidden bidding (one bid per round per bidder, unseen to others), bidding round (multiple bids seen by other participants until no more bids are received), or combination format.\\nThe ministry’s preferred format is the combination auction system.\\nImage: Utsira Nord, via 4C Offshore’s interactive map.\\nScope: 465 kW – 500 MW floating wind connected to shore radially.\\nThe ministry has decided to advertise three areas of up to 500 MW each.\\nThis is based on feedback received on earlier plans to divide Utsira Nord into areas for larger (500-600 MW) and smaller (250-300 MW) projects.\\nIt was suggested that smaller projects would be better demonstrated at test centres, allowing larger areas in Utsira Nord to benefit from economies of scale.\\nSupport: State aid will be allocated ‘at some point in the concession process’.\\nThe government wishes state aid to be as low as possible.\\nPotential support models include investment support and bilateral CfDs.\\nSee under SNII for details.\\nEither way, the government intends to include a maximum amount, to avoid overcompensation.\\nProcess: Developers will need to submit company information, binding agreements for any consortium relationships, a letter of application, and full project concept details.\\nIn the documents, the ministry proposes five main assessment criteria, each worth up to 4 points: 1.\\nCost-effectiveness – assuming a 2030 operations date with low costs weighted positively.\\nEstimates’ plausibility and candidates’ relationship with cost uncertainty will be assessed.\\nLCOE estimates and independent quality assurance of these are required.\\n2.\\nContribution to innovation and technology development – candidates must demonstrate a clear cost saving technological innovation.\\nThey will be assessed against other competing applications and plausibility.\\nConcepts with the potential for diffusion and scaling will be weighted positively.\\n3.\\nFeasibility – the applicant must be sufficiently financially strong.\\nA minimum financial capacity will be specified in tender documents (not yet determined), with higher strength more positively weighted.\\nThe project plan will also be considered in terms of how realistic operation by 2030 is.\\n4.\\nSustainability – measured in terms of climate footprint (evidence of analyses with preference given to lower footprints), coexistence (evidence of a plan for coexistence), recycling and reuse (a plan for reusing major elements in the wind farm is required, with more recycling weighted positively), and area efficiency (expected to produce at least 3.5 MW/km2).\\n5.\\nPositive local ripple effects – based on competence, impact on small and medium sized enterprises, and development of the supplier industry, with applicants compared against one another.\\nThe framework consultation documents included two possible competition models, both separating land allocation and financial support as separate competitions (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nNorway: Energy Commission Calls for New Targets, CfDs, and Greater Clarity The Energy Commission released a report to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in February, titled More of Everything – Faster.\\nIt emphasizes the important role offshore wind will play in decarbonization and highlights the need for proper planning, especially around this year’s and future auctions.\\nRecommends starting with bottom-fixed offshore wind (i.e.\\nSørlige Nordsjo II) as a mature, proven, and relatively affordable alternative to floating wind.\\nHowever, it also asks for a comprehensive plan for further development of both fixed and floating.\\nImpels the state to speed up mapping and site identification along the entire coast.\\nIt also states that licensing processes should incorporate existing data from previous analyses.\\nUrges state support for the first floating wind projects (i.e.\\nUtsira Nord) – the government has publicly stated ambitions for floating wind to become subsidy-free, but the commission identifies the higher costs involved in this less mature technology.\\nIdentifies contracts for difference (CfDs) as necessary support mechanisms at least in the first phase and takes the UK as a model.\\nChastises the state for uncertainty around timing and ambition.\\nIt calls for a target of 5-20 TWh of operational offshore wind by 2030.\\nSome recommendations were not unanimous, but from a majority of Urging the government to approve Equinor’s planned Trollvind project as soon as possible, to get things moving.\\nThe 1 GW floating wind farm is designed for O&G

II, and from 500 MW to 1.5 GW of floating in Utsira Nord.\\nIndicating that the state should enter into long-term purchase agreements with offshore wind developers, with costs and profits passing on to end-users (consumers for Sørlige Nordsjo II and oil and gas for Utsira Nord).\\nFloating Pilots Can Now Progress With the inauguration of the 88 MW Hywind Tampen from Q4 2022, Norway has become the world leader for floating wind.\\nFor more information on floating wind concepts, see our regular Floating Wind Report.\\nTwo floating wind pilots are expected to progress this year.\\nSeaTwirl AB is developing a test project at the METCentre for its S2x prototype; a vertical access wind turbine with a tower connected to a floating element and keel (image, top).\\nThe concession to build this pilot was granted in March 2022.\\nAn appeal against the consents has been cleared by Norway's Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) and the project can progress.\\nWind Catching Systems is behind the Windcatcher pilot project to be installed just off the west coast, near the operational Mehuken onshore wind farm.\\nIts premise is a structure of 75 x 1 MW turbines on top of one another (image, bottom), to maximize energy production per structure and save space and money.\\nThe project secured funding from state enterprise Enova in October 2022 (kr22 m [€2 m]) and February 2023 (kr .3 m [€ 50,000]) to develop the demo, firstly as a single onshore turbine.\\nCurrently, under the Tax Act, companies and individuals resident in Norway are taxed on income from renewable energy.\\nThis creates more of an incentive for foreign players – or those resident elsewhere for tax purposes – than for domestic ones.\\nA Ministry of Finance proposal, submitted in 2022, would introduce tax liability for foreign companies and persons participating in mineral activities utilizing renewable energy resources, or carrying out carbon management on the Norwegian continental shelf.\\nThe aim is to level the playing field.\\nThe proposal is to be presented to the Storting this year.\\nIf it passes, it will enter into force in 2024.\\nPROFITS COULD BE TAXED FOR FOREIGN PLAYERS Image via Wind Catching Systems  Portugal: Public Consultation Opened for 11 GW of Offshore Wind The Portuguese government has set a target of 10 GW offshore wind by 2030, to be allocated via competitive auction in Q3 2023.\\nIn January, the government opened a public consultation on a Preliminary Proposal for Spatialized Areas and Points for Connection to the National Transportation Network of Electricity.\\nIn it, 11 GW of offshore wind are divided across nine areas, seven of which are dedicated to floating wind.\\n▪ The seven floating wind areas total 3,393.44 km2,with a 10 GW potential, located in water depths of 75-200 m. ▪ The two fixed-bottom areas total 190,54 km2,with 1 GW potential, located in a maximum water depth of 50 m. ▪ Five onshore areas have been identified for 400 kV grid connection points.\\nThe site conditions are summarized in the table below, ranked high to low based on how favourable the conditions are.\\nFor example, a site with high capacity, closer to shore and with high wind speed will be ranked well.\\nofftake regimes.\\nDespite this high ambition, bottlenecks persist: long permitting procedures, public objections, conflicts with fisheries, grid infrastructure, and lack of port and supply chain development.\\n* 1 GW spread across both sites 1 Ranking determined by capacity, area, water depth, distance to shore, and wind speed where 1 indicates favorable conditions and 7 indicates least favorable (pro-rata)  Spain: 15 GW Potential From Offshore Wind Priority Zones The Spanish Government has approved the Maritime Space Management Plans (POEMs) after five years of consultations, relating to the five areas: North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Strait and Alboran, Levantine-Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.\\nThe POEM will be in force until December 31st 2027, and renewed every six years thereafter.\\nThe POEM outlines areas with greatest potential for offshore wind, shown in the maps below, totalling 4,948 km2.\\nA total capacity of 15 GW could be procured from these sites, assuming a power density of 3 MW/km2.\\nSpanish offshore wind projects undergoing consultations with MITECO have been overlaid, showing where developers are most interested.\\nThe most popular areas seem to be Gran Canaria, Galacia, and Catalonia.\\nThe least popular areas seem to be Fuerteventura and Menorca.\\nOffshore wind tenders are expected this year, initially in the Canary Islands.\\n* Assuming power density of 3 MW/km2  Puerto Rico: Is There a Place for Offshore Wind?\\nThe US Department of Energy (DoE) has issued a preliminary analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for its two- year study, The Puerto Rico Grid Resilience and Transitions to 100% Renewable Energy Study (PR100).\\nThe final report is due in December 2023.\\nThe study finds that Puerto Rico can acheive100% renewable energy by 2050, with a strengthened grid.\\nPuerto Rican renewable (wind and solar) energy potential ‘significantly exceeds’ demand through 2050.\\nHowever, this cannot be achieved with only utility-scale solar and onshore wind, because of the large proportion of agricultural land that cannot be built upon.\\nThe report calls for offshore wind and floating PV as potential solutions and builds on a 20-year weather analysis.\\nModelling offshore wind, it looked at four areas – northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast – and found: Peak windspeeds at midday in the northeast.\\nHigher night-time wind speeds in the other areas.\\nVery strong average wind speeds (>30 m/s) were captured especially in the northeast during Hurricane Maria in 2017.\\nAs part of its modelling, it identified several exclusion zones for offshore wind development (black in the image).\\nThese include UXOs, danger zones, and ocean disposal sites but not benthic habitats or any areas that might be excluded due to citi ens’ concerns such as viewshed.\\nIt also models a levelized cost of energy that is lower within the decade if renewables are deployed than if existing generation is maintained.\\nAn earlier NREL study estimated LCOE for offshore wind in Puerto Rico to range from $ /MWh (€ 4.\\n/MWh) to $ 5 /MWh (€ 42.\\n0/MWh), assuming commissioning of 5 MW+ turbines in 2030, falling 14% by 2035.\\nGrid: The grid, according to NREL, can accommodate renewable growth over the next 5-15 years, but will need upgrading to accommodate offshore wind – which would be unlikely to be in the water before the mid-to-late 2030s.\\nPuerto Rico’s power grid needs improved resilience as a consequence of natural disasters, most recently Hurricane Fiona in 2022.\\nIt has been severely impacted by hurricanes and earthquakes.\\nIn 2022, US President Biden requested an emergency $3 bn (€2.\\nbn) to provide solar energy and battery storage systems to low-income households in Puerto Rico.\\nHe also pledged ‘to deploy and expedite more resources from the Department of Energy and other federal agencies ... to help transform the entire system.’ LUMA Energy has operated the island’s grid since 202 in a public- private partnership and generation was privatized in January.\\nLUMA has been rumoured to be considering expanding LNG.\\nA US DoE official has suggested that this approach would be unwise.\\nAs of FY 2022, only 3% of generated from renewables.\\nfrom fossil fuels (pie chart).\\nThe reliance on petroleum has storage, as its last refinery closed in 2009.\\nImage: Offshore wind exclusion zones (black) in Puerto Rico, modelled by NREL.\\nImage via NREL.\\nUnder the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act (Act No.\\n17 of 2019), Puerto Rico is required to reach 100% renewable electricity by 2050.\\nThe Act includes interim goals of 40% by 2025 and 60% by 2040.\\nIn addition, it requires a phase- out of coal power generation by 2028 (timeline).\\nThe 2025 target will likely be missed, given the mix as of 2022.\\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, an island in the Caribbean, is an unincorporated territory of the United States.\\nThe US maintains significant control over some aspects of how Puerto Rico is run, but the Department of Energy has no say over how the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority meets its renewable energy targets.\\nWhile the PR100 study has no legislative significance, its findings are expected to help shape energy policy going forward.\\nIn particular, its solar and wind data sets are freely available and would likely be used in regime planning.\\n97% fossil fuels, 3% renewables Current electricity mix in Puerto Rico  United States: Efforts to Streamline Consent The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has proposed rules to simply for the consenting process for outer continental shelf (OCS) developments including offshore wind.\\nThese include: ▪ Regular publication of schedules renewable energy lease sales (five-year vision).\\nThis is already the case for oil and gas, and BOEM published the first five-year offshore wind leasing schedule in 2021.\\n▪ Updated pre- and post-auction processes.\\nBOEM has introduced factors beyond price in recent auctions (see Q1 2022 Market overview) including bidding credits, incentivizing, for example, local labour.\\nUnder the new rules, winning bidders will be obliged to honour any such commitments or provide compensation.\\n▪ Removing the Site Assessment Plan (SAP).\\nCurrently, leaseholders are obliged to submit a SAP prior to major survey activity that will inform the Construction and Operations Plan (COP), which forms the basis of consent.\\nNew rules would deem a permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), already required in addition to the SAP, sufficient.\\n▪ Codifying and clarifying the project design envelope (PDE) approach.\\nCOPs usually include a PDE featuring a range of options, e.g.\\nfor number of turbines, foundation type, or installation method.\\nBOEM has studied PDEs in the UK and is proposing explicit guidance on this matter, enabling it to approve some or all of the approaches in the envelope.\\n▪ Rescheduling decommissioning costings.\\nProjects should be decommissioned within two years of the lease expiring.\\nCurrently, leaseholders need a fully funded decommissioning plan before they can build.\\nHowever, the new rules would shift responsibility for a funding schedule to a date after the start of commercial operations.\\nThe change acknowledges differences between offshore renewables and oil and gas; namely, the former has more consistent power supply levels.\\nThe proposed Renewable Energy Modification Rule was published in the Federal Register in January, with technical corrections in February.\\nResponses are due by 31st March 2023.\\nBOEM has also sought to smooth out consenting with a first-of-its- kind Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for areas leased in the New York Bight due in draft form this September and in final form in 2024.\\nThe bureau usually conducts an EIS while evaluating a COP, and the aim of this is to speed things up with common groundwork across leases ahead of time (see Q3 2022 Market Overview).\\n13 GW+ Could Be Approved in 2023 BOEM expects to reach decisions on seven COPs this year (ROD = Record of Decision), totalling up to 13,270 MW of approved There are currently two approved COPs, representing less than 1 GW: for Vineyard Wind (804 MW) and South Fork (120 MW), under construction in Massachusetts and New York respectively.\\nIt is common for ROD targets to shift back, for instance if developers withdraw or alter a COP or because of departmental delays.\\nIt is possible but not highly likely that all these projects will be approved by end-2023.\\nCurrently, three decisions are scheduled for 2024 (New England Wind, SouthCoast Wind, and US Wind Maryland), but that number may rise in the coming months.\\nThe latest draft Environmental Impact statement (EIS), released for public consultation in February, was for SouthCoast Wind (formerly Mayflower Wind).\\nThe draft EIS is under consultation for 45 days, after which BOEM will use its findings to inform the final EIS.\\nThis in turn will inform the ROD (expected January 2024), which will determine whether the COP has been approved.\\new ersey’s third offshore wind RFP is expected this quarter – i.e.\\nby end-March.\\nThis call, for 1.2-4 GW, will require bidders to incorporate transmission solutions selected under the State Agreement Approach (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nBidding will close in Q2 and winners will be selected in Q3 2023.\\nUpdate: As we went to press (7th March 2023), the RFP was issued – further updates can be expected in the Q2 Market Overview.\\nThe Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) is obliged to open its fourth offshore wind solicitation (83C-IV) by 7th May 2023.\\nIn February, it requested public comments on the RFP – not on a draft but on scoping questions, such as how much offshore wind should be procured, what approach should be taken to transmission, etc.\\nBased on previous years’ timelines, we can expect the RFP to be submitted to the DPU for approval in early-to-mid-March.\\nUnited States: Gulf of Mexico Auction Inches Closer ▪ Avangrid Renewables – the US arm of Iberdrola, with a portfolio including the under-construction Vineyard Wind 1 in Massachusetts.\\nIt is also developing Park City Wind, Commonwealth Wind, and Kitty Hawk Wind.\\n▪ 547 Energy – an investor focused on renewables and cleantech; its portfolio company BlueFloat Energy is active in floating wind in the UK, Italy, Spain, Australia, and Colombia.\\n▪ Shell New Energies US – the oil major has partnerships in the US with EDF Renewables on Atlantic Shores and with Ocean Winds on Mayflower Wind.\\nIt has partnered in projects in the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, and South Korea.\\n▪ Enterprize Energy USA (pending) – a European developer most notably developing offshore wind in Vietnam and Taiwan.\\nIt also has plans in Brazil.\\n▪ Hecate Energy Gulf Wind – a US-based renewables developer, Hecate has no offshore wind pipeline, but proposed the Cascadia Offshore Wind project in Washington State in 2022.\\n▪ TotalEnergies Renewables USA – the multi-energy company entered the US offshore wind scene last year, winning a lease in the New York Bight and bid unsuccessfully in California.\\n▪ US Mainstream Offshore – the US branch of Mainstream has developed onshore wind but is now focused solely on offshore.\\nIt bid unsuccessfully in the New York Bight and prequalified for but did not bid in California.\\nWhile the Gulf has great potential for floating wind – and Louisiana is expecting to launch a floating pilot in under five years – these areas all suit fixed-bottom technology.\\nDepending on regional momentum and developer interest, we may see floating leases in the Gulf of Mexico before the end of the decade, but not in this round.\\nMaps: Galveston and Lake Charles draft lease areas.\\nThe GW capacities are forecast by TGS.\\nBOEM has issued a Proposed Sale Notice (PSN) for three areas in the Gulf of Mexico.\\nTwo are offshore Galveston, Texas, and one is offshore Lake Charles, Louisiana (maps).\\nThe PSN is now subject to a 60-day public comment period, which ends on 25th April.\\nFeedback will be incorporated into the Final Sale Notice (FSN), which is expected later this year.\\nIt is possible that only two areas – one off Texas and one off Louisiana – will be offered, and BOEM has asked explicitly for comments on which of the Galveston areas would be preferred.\\nThe proposed lease areas represent large reductions of the wind energy areas previously put to consultation (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nThe Lake Charles Area makes up 54% of WEA M, while Galveston I and II combined make only 36% of WEA I.\\nThe Galveston areas in particular may run into problems with the United States Coast Guard (USCG), which informed BOEM that southern parts of WEA I could conflict with its lightering operations.\\nBOEM noted that the USCG recommended a 2 nm (3.7 km) buffer around shipping fairways in the Gulf, suggesting that the concept of a buffer zone may be considered at COP stage, i.e., after auction.\\nIn line with the reforms proposed above, this PSN includes lease stipulations prioritizing work force training, community engagement, and fisheries support.\\nSix entities have prequalified and two are pending qualification to ▪ Bluepoint Wind (pending) – a partnership between Ocean Winds (EDPR/ENGIE) and Global Infrastructure Partners, which acquired a lease in the New York Bight auction of 2022  United States: New York Auction Proves Popular The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) closed its third offshore wind solicitation in January for 2- 4.6 GW.\\nAll six developers who had registered intentions to bid did so, with over 100 bids representing eight proposed project (table).\\nNotably, multiple proposals concern lease areas acquired in 2022, with only Bay State Wind, Beacon Wind 2, and Liberty Wind being more mature based in older lease areas.\\nThe process from leasing to offtake to permitting appears to be speeding up.\\nLavish project announcements are common from developers during these auctions and their assessment periods.\\nLess usually, the broader supply chain has unveiled plans conditional on the outcomes, due to the inclusion of Supply Chain Investment Plans (SCIPs) in this round.\\nAt the Port of Coeymans, Siemens Gamesa and GE are each planning to build manufacturing facilities (Siemens Gamesa has proposed one for nacelles, while GE has proposed one for nacelles and one for blades).\\nThe two parties have been involved in legal disputes over patent infringement in competing turbine models for some time now (see Q3 2022 Market Overview).\\nResults are expected in Q2 2023.\\nThe price of ORECs will be particularly noteworthy as volatile supply chain costs are expected to drive up the price of offshore wind energy.\\nN w Y k’s Mas Pla : D p a YSER A’s Offshore Wind Master Plan 2.0: Deep Water, a roadmap for unlocking floating wind potential in New York up to 2050, was expected to launch in 2022 and even highlighted in the Governor’s State of the State address for 2022.\\nHowever, it has not kicked off, while NYSERDA has made it known that the 9 GW by 2035 offshore wind target may be increased.\\nIt is likely that attention will turn to increased targets and floating potential after procurements in the current RFP.\\nThe OREC solicitation could result in the state’s full GW target being procured.\\nThere is also an appetite to assess the success of integrating energy storage projects into offshore wind proposals, a new feature of this round which has proven controversial because of inconsistent REC compensation levels.\\nYSER A’s Energy Storage

NYSERDA.\\nUnited States: More Challenges and Opportunities Along the East Coast Federal plans to lease in the Gulf of Maine are progressing.\\nGiven water depths (>50 m), these will be floating wind projects.\\nWhile there are plans to lease deepwater in the Central Atlantic round and, later, closer to New York, the Gulf of Maine is expected to be the leading east coast floating wind ground.\\nThere are two strands to BOEM’s current wind leasing activities in the gulf: 1.\\nA research lease area.\\nThe State of Maine requested a lease for a 12 turbine, 144 MW research array in 2021.\\nIn August 2022, BOEM requested competitive interest, and in January 2023 it determined that there was none, so the application can proceed without a competition.\\nThe next step will involve an environmental review.\\nThe State of Maine sees the research array as complementing and informing conversations around its offshore wind roadmap.\\nA draft roadmap was released in December, but it requires detail and refinement.\\n2.\\nCommercial leasing.\\nBOEM is planning to auction in one or more lease areas in the Gulf of Maine in 2024.\\nIn August 2022, BOEM issued a request for interest (RFI), covering a very large area (~55,450 km2).\\nResponses have not yet been published.\\nFinal call areas will be published in April 2023.\\nConsultations on this area are ongoing; BOEM intends to hold the next task force in Spring 2023.\\nThe area will be narrowed down into wind energy area(s) and then again into potential lease(s).\\nThe timeline may stretch beyond 2024 for the commercial lease sale.\\nChagrin continues in the field of state-level power purchase agreements (PPAs; see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nIn December, Avangrid filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to withdraw its power PPA contract for the 1,232 MW Commonwealth Wind.\\nIn the filing, it described the project as ‘unfinanceable’ and thus unlawful since the relevant law concerns ‘the financing of offshore wind energy generation’.\\nCommonwealth Wind’s 20-year PPA, secured in 2021, has a starting price of $5 .\\n0/MWh (€5 .5 /MWh).\\nAvangrid sought and failed to renegotiate its terms with the DPU, leading to this request and plans to bid in the state’s next procurement round, later this year.\\nThe DPU denied the motion to dismiss.\\nInstead, it approved the contract, describing the costs as ‘reasonable’ and ‘in the public interest’.\\nIn anuary, Avangrid filed a notice of appeal, reiterating that the project ‘cannot be financed and built under the current PPA’.\\nIt suggests that approving the PPA is not in accordance with the law and constitutes an unnecessary hurdle to the state achieving its renewable targets.\\nAs of February, Avangrid ‘remains committed to submitting the Commonwealth Wind project to the upcoming Massachusetts auction.’ The issues with Commonwealth Wind signify a shifting scene, impacted by rising prices in the supply chain, especially of steel.\\nWhile tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, especially the extended Investment Tax Credit (see Q1 2022 Market Overview), will help with affordability, the climate of driving down PPA prices (graph) potentially impacts the technology’s attractiveness in the short term.\\nIn its 2022 financial results, Ørsted reported that it had devalued its Sunrise Wind project in New York due to cost inflation and rising interest rates.\\nThe company reported an impairment of r2.5 bn (€340 m) in 2022 (for more information, see Corporate Catchup).\\nUnder ew York’s 20 solicitation, the project has a 25-year indexed OREC with a strike price of $83.36/MWh, levelized to 2018$.\\nThe leveli ed nominal price is $ 0.3 /MWh (€ 04.2 /MWh).\\nd w wa d d, b will i las Political rhetoric opposing offshore wind in the US has focussed recently on the deaths of humpback whales.\\nSince January 2016, 181 dead humpback whales have washed ashore along the coast (as of February 2023) and with between 0 and 34 such deaths a year, an ‘Unusual Mortality Rate’ has been declared.\\nIn January, several environmental groups mounted pressure on the White House and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to take action, implying a link between the increased deaths and offshore wind- related activities.\\nOAA responded with statistics showing ‘no known connections between any offshore wind activities and any whale strandings.’ BOEM and OAA have devised an offshore wind strategy including real-time acoustic monitoring the minimize impacts.\\nHowever, the attack line around humpback whales has become cemented in some media discourse, even spreading into proposed legislation, and developers and investors will likely encounter it going forward.\\nUruguay: Site Exclusivity Tenders to Start This Year Uruguay’s Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining is keen to establish large quantities of green hydrogen, powered by offshore wind.\\nIts Green Hydrogen Roadmap, published in 2021, called for studies into hydrogen production potential based on offshore wind power to begin by 2024, with the aim of production by 2040.\\nUnder its H2U programme, the National Administration of Fuels, Alcohols and Portland (ANCAP) is expected to launch the first offshore wind-related tender this year.\\nThe tender is not for rights to develop but for exclusive rights to carry out feasibility analysis at developers’ own expense and risk, with potential to submit a Project Development Plan up to ten years after tender award (see timeline).\\nBidding terms were drafted in May 2022 and published in January 2023.\\nANCAP assumes approval of these terms in Q1, giving the following deadlines for the first round: April 2023: Qualification.\\nCompanies have to the last working day of April to submit letters of intent.\\nThey will be notified of their qualification status by the penultimate working day of May.\\nMay 2023: Submission.\\nOffers must be submitted by 14:00 on the last working day of May.\\nOffers will be opened to consultation by 14:30 on the same day.\\nOctober 2023: Contract signature.\\nANCAP will determine the best proposal for each area by the last working day of August.\\nSubject to approval by the Executive Branch, contracts will be signed in October.\\nA second round of proposals is scheduled to run on the same timeframe, but six months later, so starting by end-October, after the results of Round 1, with decisions in February and contracts in May 2024.\\nThis schedule has the potential for delay, as the terms have not yet been approved.\\nThe plan is to replicate this process for up to two tender.\\nSource: ANCAP.\\nyears (four rounds) until areas have been assigned or interest has dried up.\\nANCAP then envisages 2-10 years before developers can submit Development Plans for the areas (timeline), which would mean offshore wind and large-scale hydrogen production unlikely to start before the late 2030s.\\nCompanies can qualify as operators (100% working interest or at least 30% in a consortium) or non-operators (as a consortium partner with up to 10% participation).\\nOperators must have experience in the last five years of operating, partnering, or developing one of these: A 50 MW+ offshore wind farm.\\nOr, More than 50 ton/year of green hydrogen by electrolysis (or equivalent amount of derivatives).\\nOr, More than 50,000 BOE/day of offshore oil and/or gas.\\nSite investigations after contract award are divided into three sub- periods (timeline).\\nIf there are multiple bids for an area, ANCAP will evaluate planned activities for the first two periods alongside the above technical qualifications and financial conditions (equity and assets over the contract period).\\nPeriod 1 (2 years) involves four mandatory desktop studies – physical, biological, anthropic, and technological-commercial – and up to four other studies related to conditions, risks, and impacts.\\nPeriod 2 (4 years) includes five mandatory surveys/studies – metocean/resources, environmental, and human/socioeconomic.\\nPeriod 3 (4 years) includes a potential pilot project or other form of data acquisition and a FEED study.\\nFindings from these periods would inform a Development Plan, which the contract-holder can submit up to ten years after contract award.\\nApproval would still require local and other consents to build, which have not yet been clarified.\\nAlternatively, an operator could relinquish their contract, in which case the area could be developed by another party.\\nTimeline: Construction time is based on OSW trends; other estimates come from ANCAP.\\nAustralia: First Licensing Round Draws International Interest In December, the Australian government declared the first area for offshore energy in the Bass Strait off Gippsland and opened the area for feasibility licence applications, with a submission window from 23rd January to 27th April 2023.\\nThe announcement is in line with the State of ictoria’s targets for 2 GW of offshore by 2032, 4 GW by 2035, and GW by 2040 (see Q1 2022 Market Overview).\\nThe declared area has been reduced following public consultation.\\nThe final declared area (15,000 km2) has the potential to supply more than 10 GW annually (map, next slide).\\nUnder the licensing framework (OEI), which

capability.\\nApplicants awarded merit based on how robust is the PDP outlining activities to be undertaken during feasibility process and how these will support timely FID and higher merit to those which identify specific complexities of project area.\\nRoute to Market: Preferred option for supply or transmission of the electricity and/or renewable energy products including grid connection agreements and end user/offtake agreements.\\nA more comprehensive schedule and options is awarded higher merit Estimated commercial return: Assessment will consider commercial complexities that need to be addressed and how these are included in the PDP.\\nThis may include investor milestones, funding targets beyond feasibility activities, proposed financing methods, construction schedules, commercial and economic assumptions, annual energy production forecasts and before and after tax cash flows, potential to resolve commercial barriers and refine uncertainty ranges for significant variables.\\nA clear pathway to finalising commercial agreements, including evidence of agreements to be negotiated, would be assessed as higher merit Any other matters Minister deems relevant

Second Offshore Wind Zone Announced The Albanese government has announced a second offshore wind zone in the Pacific Ocean off the Hunter coast, New South Wales (NSW).\\nA consultation will run from 23rd February to 28th April, after which the Minister for Climate Change and Energy may declare the area and open it for feasibility licence applications.\\nThe NSW state government is targeting the construction of 12 GW of renewable energy by 2030 as well as 2 GW of long-duration storage like pumped hydro.\\nThe Energy Corporation of NSW, the state government-controlled body leading development of renewable energy hubs, aims to set official state targets for offshore wind and a report on potential buildout is expected in 2023 (see H2 2022 Floating Report).\\nHunter is Australia’s largest regional economy, valued at over $40 bn (€25.\\nbn) and known for manufacturing, mining and energy exports, and energy-intensive industries such as aluminium and steel.\\nOffshore wind can leverage technical expertise and aid decarbonisation of industry following closure of coal-fired power stations in the Hunter including Lidell, Eraring ,and Bayswater.\\nThe area is within the government’s proposed Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), which was declared in December 2022.\\nThe request for expressions of interest in the REZ attracted 40 GW of project proposals, including seven offshore wind farms, and over $100 bn (€ 4 bn) of potential investment (see H2 2022 Floating Report).\\nThe REZs bring together investment in renewable energy, storage, and transmission infrastructure to ensure efficient coordinated approach.\\nEnergyCo, as the infrastructure planner, will work with network operators to deliver any required augmentations to transmission infrastructure.\\nHowever, this is initially limited to 1 GW of grid capacity, targeting onshore wind and solar, and intended to increase over time to accommodate offshore wind.\\nNSW has a long coastline and extensive continental shelf.\\nThe area is at least 5.4 nm (10 km) from shore and much deeper than Gippsland will rely on floating (table).\\nThe government has conducted a preliminary consultation with commonwealth and New South Wales government agencies identifying possible conflicts and use and contraints: Requirements under the Native Title Act 1993 may apply for onshore infrastructure.\\nThe area contains designated biologically important areas (BIAs) for migrating humpback whales and foraging seabirds and is close to a BIA for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins.\\nThe Port Stephens – Great Lakes Marine Park is immediately adjacent to the northwest boundary of the preliminary area.\\nThere are a number of matters of national environmental significance (MNES; e.g.\\nbirds, cetaceans, rays, and turtles) in and near the area and Ramsar sites (Hunter Estuary Wetlands)).\\nProposals must not interfere with recovery plans for MNES, long-term conservation or

due to the end of central subsidies from 2022 and a lack of clarity around local government policies.\\nBy the end of 2022, Jiangsu Province had a cumulative capacity of 11.8 GW, accounting for 41% of the total installed capacity nationwide.\\nThis is followed by Guangdong with 27%, and Zhejiang and Fujian with 8% each.\\nWith the release of provincial development plans for offshore wind power during the 14th Five-Year Plan in 2022, and the introduction of provincial subsidies for offshore wind power in some provinces (see Q4 2022 Market Overview), 4C Offshore estimates a significant boost in the installed capacity of offshore wind in China by 2023.\\nChina's National Energy Administration (NEA) has set a target of installing around 65 GW of (offshore and onshore) wind power in 2023.\\n4C forecasts installed offshore wind capacity in 2023 at 6.67 GW based on current schedules.\\nThe following provinces made strategic announcements in January: ▪ Guangdong.\\nThe Guangdong provincial government's annual work report refers to ’support[ing] the construction of the Shantou International Wind Power Innovation base’ (image).\\nThis is the third time since 2022 that a key meeting of the government has emphasized developing this site, so it may be accelerated.\\n▪ Guangxi.\\nThe government of Qinzhou City, Guangxi Province, issued a circular stating that offshore wind construction should be accelerated, aiming for 10 GW by 2025.\\n▪ Fujian.\\nThe Development and Reform Commission of Fujian Province issued its ‘ otice on the Issuance of the 2023 Provincial ey Projects List’, which includes three key offshore wind 1.\\nThree Gorges Fujian Zhangpu Liu'ao Offshore Wind Farm 2.\\nCTGC Pingtan phase I Offshore Wind Farm (100 MW); 3.\\nNingde Xiapu Offshore Wind Farm Area B (300 MW Most offshore turbine capacity to be deployed in China in 2023-4 is expected to be below 12 MW, during which time several wind turbine installation vessels (WTIVs) – retrofitted or new jack-ups – will be delivered, mostly with lifting capacities below 1,600 t, which is still sufficient to complete the installation of turbines.\\nHowever, there may soon be a shortage of foundation installation vessels (FIVs).\\nThe largest monopiles at this stage already exceed 2,000 tonnes, and there will not be many FIVs delivered in 2023-4.\\nChina's offshore wind market shows very high ambitions in the 14th Five-Year Plan (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nIn the era of price parity for offshore wind in China, employing larger turbines has become an obvious way to reduce costs, which means that at least another 5-10 large foundation installation vessels will be in demand if the target can be reached.\\n4C estimates that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, multiple wind farms could fail to deploy turbines of the desired size due to a shortage of FIVs that meet the requirements.\\nAs a result, it may be difficult for China to achieve its offshore wind power installation targets during the period.\\nImage Guangdong Offshore Wind Power Yuedong Site  China: Turbine Sizes Show Dramatic Increase Since 2022, ten new offshore wind turbine models have been announced in China, coming from seven Chinese offshore wind turbine manufacturers, as shown in the table.\\nThe trend towards larger turbines has accelerated, with Goldwind launching a 16 MW model and CSSC launching an 18 MW model in recent months, an increase in maximum unit capacity of 7 MW compared to 2021.\\nThe average unit capacity of offshore wind turbine models to be launched after 2022 is 11.5 MW.\\nMore than 85% of offshore wind turbine projects tendered in 2022 have an average unit power greater than 8 MW.\\nWith large- scale production of these new wind turbine models in next few years, 4C estimates that the average unit capacity of offshore wind turbines installed in China will exceed 10 MW by 2025 (see graph below).\\nZhangpu Liuao Phase II in Fujian (map) will be the first offshore wind project in China to employ turbines of 16 MW and above.\\nTaking a long-term view, CSSC plans to test the H260-18MW prototype wind farm in the first half of 2023.\\nSubsequently, CSSC will continue to develop models with an output power of 25 MW or more with diameters over 300 m along the established technical route.\\nThe R&D team has been established and will launch the product when the market is suitable.\\nImage 2023 Three key offshore wind projects in Fujian  Japan: New Round of Auctions and Future Legislation apan’s Round 2 auctions officially began in ecember 2022, with four sites opening to auction (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nThe bid submission window will close end-June 2023.\\nWinners are expected to be announced by March 2024, and possibly this year.\\nPublicly announced applicants for each site are as follows: Murakami and Tainai (700 MW) Moving Towards a Centralized System The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) have established a ‘Central Method’ (セントラル方式) for offshore wind.\\nIt has the government involved from the beginning, conducting surveys in auction zones on behalf of private companies for financial efficiency and reduced effort (the government will conduct the necessary surveys, avoiding the duplications and expenditure of each company conducting the same surveys for themselves over a much longer period).\\nThis will reduce conflicts with fisheries, trade ships, local residents, etc.\\ndue to shorter occupation periods and fewer maritime activities.\\nMETI and MLIT have revised the law to add geological research work related to offshore wind to the work of the Japan Energy and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC).\\nFrom FY2023, JOGMEC will conduct surveys in three areas in the Hokkaido prefecture for future auctions.\\nMETI and MLIT had received information from prefectural governments about survey areas (prospective auction sites) between October and November 2022.\\nIn January 2023, a third- party committee consisting of academic experts selected the three Hokkaido sites as the first sites to be surveyed under the central method.\\nThese three sites are expected to be auctioned off in the Round 4 auctions, which will commence in 2024 at the earliest, or may be part of a later auction Round.\\nEIA stages: Planning (1), Scoping (2), Draft EIA (3), Final EIA (4).\\nJapan: Expansion into the EEZ?\\nJapan is planning to implement an offshore wind framework for its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), enabling projects beyond its territorial sea area (up to 2 nm from shore).\\napan’s EEZ is the sixth largest in the world, extending up to 200 nm from shore (370 km).\\nExtending regulation to the EEZ will be essential for large-scale floating wind development in the next few decades.\\nThe working group tasked with determining the feasibility of building offshore wind farms in the EEZ has concluded that construction is possible if backed by national law.\\nThe government will prepare legislation and will update its marine strategy in May.\\nJapan is targeting cost reductions in offshore wind to reach the price of ¥8- /kWh (€5 -63/MWh) within 2030-2035 and localization of 60% by 2040.\\nThe push to install offshore wind farms in the EEZ could become an issue of national security, meaning the government will need to map project locations strategically.\\nConsultation with relevant parties would be necessary to design a comprehensive marine spatial plan and could take several years.\\nNew Zealand: Consultation on Regulatory Framework The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is developing a regulatory framework for offshore renewable energy, due to be in place by uly 2024, under the government’s first Emissions Reduction Plan (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nThis will include identifying regulatory gaps and options for balancing environmental impacts and co-use.\\nFit-for-purpose regulation will provide certainty to investors and provide a competitive allocation process that considers the merits and risks of development.\\nCurrently, existing regulatory regimes such as the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) and Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Act 2012 (EEZ Act) are insufficient to regulate offshore renewables.\\nApplications under these Laws are assessed on ‘first-in, first- served’ basis and there is currently no specific legislation for offshore renewables to enable proposal comparisons based on merits and risks.\\nInitial feasibility assessments are underway in Taranaki, Waikato, and Southland, where developers have expressed interest in fixed and floating (see next section).\\nHowever, developers are reluctant to engage in high-cost research and data collection without clarity on how the government intends to regulate the sector.\\nThe ministry has launched a two-phase consultation process to 1.\\nSite identification, and the regulatory settings necessary to enable prospective developers to undertake feasibility assessments.\\nLaunched in mid-December and will close 14th April.\\n2.\\nBroader regulatory settings to enable infrastructure to be constructed, operated, decommissioned, and exported to the national grid.\\nExpected mid-2023.\\nMBIE is also engaging regularly with iwi and those who have expressed an interest in developing offshore renewable projects to develop the regulatory framework.\\nThe government is targeting 100% renewable electricity generation by 2030, and 50% of total energy consumption to come from renewable sources, including offshore renewables, by 2035.\\nThese targets serve a vision for net-zero emissions by 2050.\\nProposed Approach to Feasibility Studies The government is considering a developer-led approach to feasibility analysis.\\nAs opposed to government-led regime, this allows more opportunity for developers to optimize site selection with lowest LCOE.\\nIt’s also quicker for evelopers to conduct analysis as opposed to creation of government-led sectoral plans; and fewer costs to the government.\\nHowever, developers assume more responsibility, with higher CAPEX and the risks associated with site selection.\\nA developer-led approach is considered more appropriate for an emerging market in the short to medium term with more and earlier government involvement to be introduced in the long term as the market matures.\\nThis has been a common trend seen in other markets.\\nAustralia is opting for a hybrid approach whereby the government pre-selects large areas which developers apply for permits within.\\nThe NZ government will be updating the RMA with the Spatial Planning Act (SPA) and the Natural and Built Environments Act (NBA) to create a regional spatial strategy (RSS) for each region and potentially set the path for more government involvement in the long term.\\nJapan is expected to be a key Index for Floating Wind, Japan ranks two points above France and one behind the US for on a combination of factors including technical potential, deployed capacity, and political context.\\nFind out more at the beginning of this report and be sure to consult 4C Offshore’s Global Floating Wind Report, released every six months.\\nNew Zealand: Permits and Potential Areas Currently 10-year minerals exploration permits can be awarded.\\nThe government is proposing five-year feasibility with potential for two-year extensions.\\nActivities must start within 12 months for the permit to remain valid.\\nThis is on the basis that a shorter duration for permits on a ‘use it or lose it’ basis could mitigate the risk of ‘land banking’ by developers.\\nHowever, the term is considerably shorter than the 10-year Option Agreements for the recent ScotWind leasing round in the UK or the seven-year feasibility licences in Australia.\\nTo obtain a feasibility permit, developers will be assessed on their technical, financial, and commercial capabilities, and whether the proposed development goes against Aotearoa ew Zealand’s national interest, with expected alignment in the Overseas Investment Act 2005.\\nSufficient involvement of local iwi, hapū, or whānau will also be required.\\nSome enforcement mechanism is likely to be needed, e.g.\\na regular reporting mechanism and/or penalties for non-compliance.\\nIf application areas overlap, developers may be invited to revise areas and/or be compared and awarded based on how each meet above criteria.\\nMBIE could act as body for managing permit applications.\\nKey Areas for Consideration (maps) Waikato: The greatest potential is nearshore with <60m water depths.\\nBeyond this, a broad shelf with up to 200 m water depth is suitable for floating.\\nMean windspeeds are 8.2 m/s within 60 km of the shore.\\nIt is located within 100 km of Transpower high voltage infrastructure with nearby demand centres, e.g.\\nAuckland.\\nA marine mammal sanctuary (MMS) is congruent with the territorial sea boundary (12 nm).\\nHighest levels of fishing are along the continental shelf in 100 m water depths, with recreational fishing contained to territorial waters.\\nOceanex and a consortium of BlueFloat, Energy Estate, and Elemental Group are investigating fixed and floating projects off Waikato.\\nTaranaki: The greatest potential is the South Taranaki Bight in water depths <100m and mean wind speeds of 8-11m/s, within 60 km of the shore.\\nMost of the central and northern area is within 100 km of Transpower high voltage infrastructure with nearby significant major energy consumers.\\nPort Taranaki is the only deep-water port on the West Coast of New Zealand.\\nHowever, there are constraints with fishing and vessels, existing oil and gas infrastructure, and defence force areas.\\nO&G presents opportunities for transferable experience, skills, and industry.\\nAn MMS is congruent with the territorial sea boundary.\\nOceanex, NZ Super Fund, and CIP as well as a consortium of BlueFloat, Energy Estate, and Elemental Group are investigating projects off Taranki (4 GW, combined).\\nBeach Energy is placing a LiDAR on its Kupe platform off Taranaki and will share the data with several developers.\\nSouthland: The greatest potential is towards the south and west, but this is constrained by water depths (60-1,000 m) and distance to shore.\\nOf the eastern area within 60 km, water depth is <100 m with windspeeds of 10 m/s and mostly within 100 km of HV grid.\\nThere are relatively high levels of commercial fishing.\\nand two MMSs nearshore.\\nAbility to comply with legislation Evidence of strong financial position Evidence that project risks have been Establish a permit for feasibility activities that would also provide a sole right to apply for construction and operation permits.\\nEnables the government to screen applications and gives developers confidence with award of site exclusivity.\\nevelopers, the Crown, Māori, and interested parties collaborate to conduct feasibility activities, achieving lower costs and efficiencies through resource and skills pooling.\\nHowever, costs/risk sharing would need to be formally agreed, incurring higher administrative costs.\\nPhilippines: Market Opening Up to Reach Climate Goals The Philippines Department of Energy (DOE) is planning policy reforms to grow renewables to 35% of the energy mix by 2030 and 50% by 2040.\\nAn approved amendment to the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Renewable Energy Act of 2008 removes the nationality restrictions on the exploration, development, and utilization of renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, biomass, ocean or tidal energy.\\nPreviously, the exploration and development of solar, wind, hydro, and ocean or tidal energy was subject to at least 60% ownership by Filipinos.\\nProjects can now be 100% foreign owned.\\nThe Philippines has followed the example of other Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, who have been greatly benefitted by allowing 100% foreign ownership of offshore wind projects.\\nFor example: ▪ Danish multinational Ørsted owns offshore wind farms in South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\\n▪ Australia’s Macquarie Green Investment Group has partnered with French oil and gas giant Total to develop floating wind in South Korea.\\n▪ Northland Power is developing the 1,044 MW Hai Long project in Taiwan.\\nThe archipelago is actively looking for foreign investors to tap offshore wind development opportunities.\\nIn November, the DOE awarded 42 offshore wind service contracts with a projected installed capacity of 31.5 GW.\\nAssuming offshore wind to cost $5 m/MW (€4.\\n4 m/MW), an approximately $ 5 .5 bn (€ 4 .\\n5 bn or ₱ .\\ntrn) investment is required to deploy this capacity.\\nChinese Firms to Invest in Filipino Renewables Following President Marcos’ visit to China, nine Chinese companies have pledged to invest a combined $ 3. bn (€ 2. bn) in renewable energy development, energy storage systems, and off-grid power supply systems in the Philippines.\\nMost of these companies have been directly or indirectly involved in offshore wind in China, so could be expected to explore the enormous offshore wind potential in the Philippines.\\nTwo European-based companies have unveiled plans to invest in the Philippines’ renewable energy sector.\\nSee table, right.\\nThe Philippines has presented at the World Economic Forum (WEF) with the government’s plan to establish a sovereign wealth fund, known as the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), for investments in agriculture, clean energy, digitalization, and climate change (Sovereign wealth funds are state-owned investment funds usually financed by surplus revenues or reserves).\\nThe proposal has faced immense criticism at home.\\nFirstly, the option looks unpractical due to the country’s growing debt and a lack of surplus money.\\nSecondly, critics argue that a sovereign wealth fund would lack transparency and create opportunities for corruption.\\nDespite criticism at home, the proposed MIF is gaining attention from outside.\\nFor instance, the government claims that the Japanese government and private firms have already pledged to invest in the fund.\\nSince the Philippines does not have funds to invest in large and costly development projects, including offshore wind projects, the sovereign wealth fund is expected to be mostly dominated by foreign investors.\\nSPIC has the largest installed capacity of wind power in Guangxi, China, with around 1/9 GW of offshore wind operational and a further 4 GW under development.\\nSPIC has also been involved in various substation projects in China.\\nCGN is the owner and developer of several under construction and operational offshore wind projects.\\nCHEC is an established offshore wind owner and developer.\\nMingyang the world’s sixth largest wind turbine generators manufacturer, has a cumulative installation of 45 GW.\\nCEIG has been operating in the Philippines for more than two decades.\\nIts operations involve power generation, substation, transmission, cell site and fibre-to-home and data centre projects.\\nDHI is the largest private Chinese fabricator of monopiles, transition pieces, and offshore towers.\\nIt is also developing jackets and floating foundations.\\nThe company has supplied foundations to European developers (UK and France).\\nCMEC is one of the top 500 companies in China, and has collaborated with Asia Solar Energy of the Philippines and the Philippine Waste Management Corporation to build solar, waste-to-energy, and other renewable energy projects.\\nCPID aka China Power, a subsidiary of SPIC, is looking into establishing local entities to invest in renewable energy projects in the Philippines.\\nCNTY is a waste management company is China, expected to invest in a similar business in the Philippines.\\nAcciona, a Spanish multinational, has pledged to invest in renewable energy and infrastructure projects.\\nAcciona’s announcement coincides with the lifting of the 40% equity cap for foreign firms in renewable energy projects, particularly solar and offshore wind.\\nPreviously, Acciona announced six floating wind projects (~4.4 GW) in Italy & Spain.\\nOCEA, a French multinational involved in maritime safety, security, and navigation as well as shipbuilding and integrated logistics support, plans to develop a shipyard in the Philippines with an investment of ₱ .5 bn (€25.44 m).\\nOcea has long aimed to capitali e on offshore renewable energy markets and its investment in Philippines is part of its plan.\\nSouth Korea: Future for Renewables Still Bright The final version of the 10th Basic Plan for Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand for 2022 to 2036 was completed in January 2023, following a first draft in August 2022 (see H2 2022 Floating Report) and a second draft in November (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nThe final figures have been set: The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE) plans to prioritize the expansion of wind energy over solar.\\nInstalled solar capacity in the country currently tops 22 GW, accounting for more than 80% of the 27 GW of installed renewables.\\nA cumulative ratio of 2:1 for solar and wind in 2036 has been targeted in the plan, i.e.\\nfor every 2 GW of solar, there should be at least 1 GW of wind operating (onshore and offshore).\\nThis is opposed to the 23:2 ratio of solar to wind in 2021.\\nThe introduction of large-scale renewables will also depend on the steady introduction of ~26.3 GW of energy storage systems (ESS) by 203 , which will require an estimated ₩2 -45 trn (€2 -33.3 bn) investment.\\nThe use of ESS is seen as necessary to mitigate the intermittent nature of electricity generation via renewables.\\nWider plans for the country include reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 44.4% in 2030 compared with the emissions level in 2018, which will largely be made possible through a reduction of coal capacity from 41.9% to 14.4% by 2036, through the closure of 28 of the total 58 coal-fired power plants by 2036.\\nA plan to reach net-zero by 2050 has been carried forward from the previous administration.\\nA significant policy of the current Yoon administration has been setting a threshold of at least 30% nuclear energy by 2030.\\nMany aspects of previous President Moon’s Green New Deal seem to have been put on hold in the process of revamping the nation’s energy policy.\\nevertheless, renewables have been addressed in several Yoon-era policies and will play an important role in decarbonizing Korean industry and society.\\nThe power mix proposed under Yoon balances the nation’s dependence on non-fossil fuel energy sources between nuclear and RE, whereas Moon tried to steer the nation’s energy policy towards a nuclear phase-out and major RE expansion.\\nBy 2030, nuclear and RE will account for 54% of the power mix under the 10th Basic Plan, compared to 45.8% (25% nuclear; 20.8% RE) previously set forth in the 9th plan (released in 2020 for the years 2020-34).\\nBy 2036, nuclear and RE will account for 65.2% of generation.\\nKorean Energy Mix by 2036 Nuclear and renewables account for 65.2% of the mix by 2036 TWh of generation by source year Further updates to Korean energy policy will come in the form of two special bills on offshore wind: the Special Bill on Site Planning and Fostering Industrial Development of Offshore Wind (AKA the Site Planning Bill) coming from the People Power Party, and the Special Bill on the Promotion of Offshore Wind Power from the Democratic Party.\\nBoth were proposed in mid-February.\\nThe Site Planning Bill proposes switching from the system of open-door applications by private companies to a state-led system, where the government manages offshore wind farm siting (selecting suitable sites for development to prevent reckless development) and organizes zones where offshore wind (OSW) can be developed.\\nOnly if a proposed offshore wind farm is selected can the project be promoted.\\nCompanies that have already received electric business licenses (EBLs) are likely to be selected in this process.\\nThose without an EBL are less likely to succeed.\\nOSW will only be promoted by companies selected through the government-led process.\\nThe government will play a larger role in stakeholder engagement/consultation so the needs and wishes of the local community and industries are not sidelined and projects will be developed with less controversy.\\nThree years after the promulgation of the Site Planning Bill, development of OWFs and applications for EBLs will not be permitted outside of specific OSW zones set by the government (reserve districts).\\nAfter the promulgation of the Site Planning Bill, the government will not grant permission for the installation of met masts/LiDARs for OSWother than in reserve districts and power generation districts.\\nSome 20 GW worth of OSW projects have received EBLs, granting exclusive development rights (site exclusivity) for four years.\\nThe siting bill raises questions, particularly around whether the government is at this late stage able to start over and what effect it may have on future OSW.\\nIt is unclear how the two bills will interact with one another, but in the long term, they are expected to result in higher quality projects being built.\\nSPECIAL BILLS COULD OVERHAUL THE CURRENT SYSTEM  Taiwan: A Year of Growth or Collapse?\\nFloating Capacity Doubles but Plans Remain Limited At the second public meeting on Taiwan’s floating wind demonstration phase, the Bureau of Energy (BoE) announced revised plans, responding to concerns and criticisms of the early draft.\\nUp to 100 MW across the phase.\\nThis cap was criticized by developers, analysts, and reporters involved in the local offshore wind industry for being too low.\\nUp to 50 MW per developer.\\nSmaller projects mean limited opportunities to achieve economies of scale.\\nGrid connection in 2026.\\nThe grid connection seemed too early and unrealistic with no planning, construction, or manufacturing experience need for floating projects in Taiwan, making the timeline unrealistic and likely unachievable.\\nFor more information, please see 4C Offshore’s H2 2022 Floating Report.\\nIn response, the BoE has made the following changes: Raising the maximum total capacity of the demonstration phase to 200 MW.\\nIncorporating government pre-determined turbine layouts using 6- 12 turbines rated at 15 MW.\\nThis raises project sizes to 90-180 MW per developer.\\nMoving the grid connection date to 2027/8.\\nThe floating demonstration phase in Taiwan now appears more attractive to developers when looking at the capacity allowance, but the limitations placed on turbine layouts and the minimum and maximum capacity of the sites by the BoE might not yield the best results possible for both the developers and Taiwan.\\nThe concerns about the low capacity were addressed, project sizes have also been raised, meaning the number of projects that can participate remains as limited as before.\\nThis may cause a longer-term problem in the Taiwanese auctions of Round Three as we move further into this decade with large-scale projects planning to utilize floating turbines on sites only supported by data from as little as two foundation designs with a short period of time to collect the data (~2 years).\\nProjects will be judged and awarded points based on: The work team (30 points) Construction plans and design (30 points) Domestic cooperation – Industry research & cooperation plan (10 points) Current official timeline for development: Progress so far has been slow and with delays and issues in other areas of the industry, there is likely to be some deliberation on delivery of final plans.\\nY li , Ba k L a s, Hai L g, a d Taiwa ’s F as a The Yunlin Yunneng project has faced considerable hurdles and though it is under new ownership, 2023 does not look set to buck the trend.\\nThe Yunlin project has filed for a further extension of its grid connection date and is willing to accept a lower FiT rate to retain its construction licence due to delays from pile slips and contracting problems in 2021 and 2022.\\nIf not approved, it is highly unlikely to be completed during this year’s construction season.\\nIf approved, the grid connection date will likely begin to approach the grid connection deadline for round 2 projects, 2026.\\nHowever, there is a more concerning third plausible fate for the Yunlin project.\\nThe construction licence could be removed by the government.\\nYunlin has been invested in by a consortium of Taiwanese banks.\\nLocal government-backed banks are notorious for only investing in low-risk opportunities.\\nThe delayed connection date and the potential loss of the construction licence have led Yunlin’s financers to worry about potential returns on investment.\\nThe concerns surrounding Yunlin have bled out to the rest of the market, with banks starting to get cold feet.\\nLocalization policies and the additional rules for enforcing these policies are also troubling for investors.\\nMany of the necessary components for localization are not yet available at scale in Taiwan.\\nThe worry for investors is the continual fines developers will receive for not meeting material and component localization deadlines.\\nThe Hai Long 2a, 2b, & 3 were all expected to make financial close in 2022, but local investors stalled and seem to be waiting to see how the market reacts and moves from the problems at Yunlin before making a final decision.\\nSome have doubted whether the Hai Long projects will ever make it to financial close due to unintended consequences of the Yunlin project’s issues.\\nThe future of the Yunlin project remains balanced on a knife edge.\\nHow it might change things for the rest of the market remains to be seen.\\nDecisions made by local banks and investors now will likely determine the market’s development.\\ndate.\\ndevelopers.\\nbriefing meeting.\\nTaiwa : R d ’s Fi s R s l s In December, the BoE announced the initial results of the first Round Three auction.\\nThe announcement consisted of only an ‘Order of Preference’ listing ten projects that were successful in the auction ordered by points awarded in the judging criteria and their planned grid connection years (order of preference holds no bearing on grid connection year).\\nCIP remains the only developer to have received the full 500 MW available plus the additional 100 MW discretionary buffer.\\nWhile all other projects have been reduced in physical size and capacity to be below the 500 MW limit, it is not currently clear exactly why other projects were not also awarded the full 500 MW.\\nIt is known that many felt that the limitations on project sizes and the low FiT rate on offer from Taipower, the national power company, impeded interest in this auction (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nDuring the auction, some developers submitted zero-bids.\\nMost developers successful in the auction are expected to secure corporate PPAs (CPPAs) from Taiwanese manufacturers and large energy consumers instead of the PPA offered by Taipower.\\nA PPA will still be signed even if they choose to have a CPPA instead.\\nVi am: ’s FiT Mechanism Resolution and PDP VIII Progre In late 2022, the Vietnamese government announced new feed-in- tariff (FiT) rates for offshore and onshore wind and solar projects.\\nThe new FiT rate is lower than the previous rate offered by EVN, the national power company, which expired in November 2021, but it does provide the market with more stability and certainty, enabling it to move forward.\\nThis should go towards reassuring the local market, but also the numerous international investors, developers, and OEMs active in Vietnam with plans to develop further offshore projects needing large amounts of investments, with a need to know where a steady and stable income will come from.\\nThe government’s attempts to keep the domestic offshore wind industry progressing have disappointed many with questions about the short-term potential of the market starting to be asked.\\nFor foreign investors and companies, working in Vietnam can be a long and arduous road, often requiring good relationships at a governmental level.\\nFor example, the current Danish activity in the market has involved the development of good state-level bilateral relationships and cooperation to develop trust over many years.\\nA move towards resolving current issues from existing projects, and especially the FiT, is a step in the right direction but time and patience will be required throughout this decade from those looking to invest in future Vietnamese offshore wind projects.\\nThere has been no official comment on whether the new FiT has been accepted by any project owners yet and whether they plan to continue with construction plans and operate under the revised FiT tariff, and how much it can re-invigorate the market for international investment remains to be seen.\\nBoth onshore and offshore FiT rates have been reduced (table).\\nit will be instructive to see how projects, currently incomplete, progress after this announcement.\\n4C Offshore expects to see the completion of projects that missed the FiT deadline in 2021 and the operation/ commissioning of those that have continued regardless of the unresolved FiT situation.\\nThe unresolved issue of incomplete projects from the nearshore developments had been one of the reasons why the eighth Power Development Plan (PDP VIII) had been delayed and deliberated over for so long.\\nThe announcement could mean we are moving closer to finally seeing PDP VIII.\\nThe document will cover detailed plans for all power-related projects in Vietnam with an outlook to 2050 including offshore wind.\\nPDP VIII was planned to be finalized in 2021 and has since hit multiple delays, bouncing between various government bodies and departments making amendments, approvals, and often disapprovals and disagreements.\\nDespite this great leap forward of introducing the new FiT rate, 4C Offshore still anticipates the PDP VIII is very unlikely to appear in the first half of this year, and possibly could be seen in a finalized and approved form during the second half of 2023 onwards.\\nNot only has the unresolved FiT scheme, discussion around policies and legislation for further from shore projects halted but Vietnam have also ousted its Prime Minister due to corruption allegations (all policies and legislation must be lastly approved by the prime minister before being enacted into Vietnamese law), likely slowing down progress in recently months and coming ones too.\\nR d c i (€/M h) E recorded record losses in 2022 of ₫3 .3 trn (€ .2 bn) and is petitioning the Ministry of Industry and Trade to increase the transmission price by 4% to help cover losses.\\nEVN claims that this is due to the global increase in the price of coal, with ietnam’s grid being largely powered by coal produced electricity and has requested a price increase of 5%.\\nThe reduction in the nearshore FiT rate could reflect E ’s troubles and an attempt to reduce its input costs.\\nBRAZIL: 2023 will be a decisive year for offshore wind in Brazil.\\nAlthough the first offshore wind auction had been anticipated for this year, it is unlikely to open before 2024 (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nNeeded in the next three quarters are details from the central government about how exactly auctions will work.\\nThere is a drive for renewables under the new Lula presidency.\\nGovernment agency workers have been liaising with their US counterparts about offshore wind development and carbon sequestration, while the Ministry of Mines and Energy has announced that 92% of a 10.3 GW increase in centralized power generation in 2023 will come from onshore wind and solar.\\nTURKEY: Turkey’s latest National Energy Plan targets 5 GW of offshore wind, alongside 24.6 GW of onshore wind, by 2035.\\nTurkey has no regulatory system in place for offshore wind development, making the target a challenge to reach in the timeframe.\\nThe World Bank is working on the final iteration of its offshore wind development roadmap for Turkey, expected to be delivered in Q1 2023.\\nIn February, south Turkey was hit by two major earthquakes, registering at 7.8 and 7.5 on the Richter scale.\\nThe tragedy has led to significant loss of life and damage to buildings and public infrastructure, with ports, oil supply, and generation facilities all impacted.\\nOffshore wind development will likely move down the list of priorities for the country and political and economic capital address the disaster.\\nBULGARIA: The Black Sea Floating Offshore Wind (BLOW) project is one of three to be awarded by the European Commission’s Hori on Europe research and innovation programme last year, all aimed at sustainable energy solutions, with a grant agreement signed at the end of 2022.\\nThis is ground-breaking as there are no offshore wind projects in the black sea and this project will be the first of its kind in the region.\\nBLOW will use Eolink's floating offshore wind turbine design and aims to engineer, manufacture, and commission the 5 MW turbine by 2025 before rolling out large-scale deployment as part of a wider industrialization process.\\nFRANCE: Senate has adopted legislation for the acceleration of renewables (ENR) (see Q4 2022 Market Overview).\\nMultiple tenders are ongoing, with the 1 GW Normandy project to be awarded March 2023.\\nFor the 250 MW Brittany floating tender, the final bid date has been delayed to June 2023 and the winner will be designated by end-2023.\\nThe choice of winner(s) for the two 250 MW Mediterranean floating tenders will be made in the autumn.\\nResults of the pre-qualification for the second South Atlantic and Centre Manche projects are expected end- February 2023 and launch of the competitive dialogue phase with winners in early 2024.\\nThe tender for the second 500 MW Brittany floater will be launched in 2024.\\nAn updated tender schedule is expected with the next Multi-aanual Energy Programme (PPE) in 2024.\\nPOLAND: The Ministry of Infrastructure in Poland is currently announcing the conclusive proceedings for each of the eleven offshore wind energy areas in the Baltic Sea.\\nSo far, PGE Baltica has received the highest number of points, and therefore location permits, for four development zones: 43.E.1, 60.E.3, 44.E.1, and 60.E.4.\\nThe development zone 53.E.1 was regarded as unresolved, since the proposed schedules did not include a deadline for obtaining a building permit.\\nThe runners up for each of these sites include (in descending order of points) EDF Renewable Offshore Polska I, Cormano, and POW-Polish Offshore Wind-Co. SSE was also a runner up for 60.E.4.\\nFinancials: Underlying Replacement Cost Profit for Q4 2022 was up 17% YoY to $4.8bn Strategy: BP has revised its long-term price assumptions and now expects oil and gas prices to remain high through much of the 2020s (a five-year extension on the previous estimate) due to the continuing war in Ukraine and resulting energy shortages.\\nBP is transforming itself into an integrated energy company (IEC) with five 'Transition Growth Engines’: Bioenergy, Convenience, EV Charging, Hydrogen, and Renewables and Power.\\nIt is 'leaning into' this strategy with An addition $8 bn ($1 bn/annum) into Bioenergy, Convenience, and EV Charging, which are expected to show returns over 15%.\\nIt expects double digit returns for H2.\\nRenewables and Power are 'relatively low return' opportunities (6-8% unlevered).\\nIt is also investing $ bn into 'today’s energy system', to target shorter cycle O&G projects and retain existing assets for longer.\\nThis will capture the higher prices it envisages for near term.\\nThe above programmes will deliver $5-6 bn higher earnings in 2030.\\nIt plans to use its refineries as 'demand anchors' for hydrogen and scale these to regional hubs to support hard- to-abate sectors.\\nIts renewable and power activities focus on creating integration value to enhance returns, i.e.\\nservicing production of green H2, e-fuels, EV charging, and trading.\\nBy 2025, it targets 5.8 GW of renewables at FID (including its first offshore wind project).\\nBy 2050 it targets 10 GW operational (including the first OWF) and 50 GW at FID.\\nIt sees the control of offshore wind assets as a source of green electrons at the lowest cost of energy, and critical to the success of the integration business (rather than buying the electrons).\\nFor example, offshore wind is the only scalable technology for servicing H2 production.\\nBP reported 5% inflation in offshore wind-related CAPEX to date (but note it is pre-FID).\\nBecause of the IRA, BP has prioritized US projects over other regions.\\nFinancials: Net operating income for Q4 2022 was $16.6 bn and net income was $7.9 bn, with adjusted earnings at $15.1 bn ($5.8 bn after tax).\\nOperating renewable assets contributed $37 m in Q4 2022, with production (517 GWh) down 2% on Q4 2021.\\nMost earnings came from exploration and production and the sale of gas.\\nFull year adjusted earnings hit $74.9 bn, more than double YoY (from $33.5 bn in 2021), making the figure after tax $28.7 bn, up from $10 bn YoY.\\nFor 2022, organic CAPEX was $8.1 bn.\\nIn its updated outlook, Equinor expects organic CAPEX of $10-11 bn in 2023 rising to approximately $13 bn for 2024-6.\\nStrategy: By 2030, Equinor intends to have reduced group- wide greenhouse gas emissions by 50%, with an expected average annual cash flow from operations after tax of around $20 bn, and ROACE over 15%.\\nIt expects to have installed 12-16 GW of renewables by 2030 with project base returns of 4-8%.\\nOffshore wind and hydrogen: So far this year, Equinor has announced partnerships with RWE and EnBW.\\nWith RWE, it is working to develop value chains for low-carbon hydrogen from gas.\\nThis will involve replacing coal-powered plants in Germany and building new gas plants in Norway, as well as exporting hydrogen from Norway to Germany and building offshore wind farms that can power hydrogen.\\nWith EnBW, it intends to partner on German offshore wind production.\\nSelected growth markets include Norway, Poland, the UK, and the US.\\nIt is aiming for floating wind leadership and a flexible power offering.\\nEquinor identifies a better risk profile with a diversified portfolio.\\nUsing European data and forecasts, it presents a higher, more consistent baseload from aggregated wind and solar.\\nNorway: Hywind Tampen (88 MW) – currently the world’s largest floating wind farm – generated first power in Q4 and will be fully commissioned in 2023.\\nIt will meet about 35% of demand for the Snolle A and B and Gullfaks A, B, and C oil platforms.\\nUK: Dogger Bank (3.6 GW), being developed with SSE and Vårgrønn, is expected to start production this year.\\nIt is being developed in three 1.2 GW phases (A, B, C).\\nEquinor and SSE each own 40%, and Vårgrønn owns 20%.\\nUS: In the US’s first west coast and first floating wind auction, Equinor paid $130 m for an 80,062-acre lease in Morro Bay, where it intends to build ‘at least 2 GW’ of floating wind.\\nIts US offshore wind pipeline now stands at 5.3+ GW.\\nFinancials: In 2022, Iberdrola made a net profit of €4.34 bn, with EBIT A increased by 0% to € 0.\\n3 bn.\\nThe company links tohis to geographic diversification (39% EU, 20% US, 5% U , and 25% Latin America).\\nIt invested € 0.\\n3 bn (a record, up 13% YoY), of which 90% was allocated to networks & renewables.\\nStrategy: Iberdrola’s strategic plan for 2023-5 includes a € bn investment in renewables, of which 46% goes to offshore wind (25% goes to onshore wind and 24% to P ), and a €2 bn in smart grids in Spain (5%), the UK (14%), Brazil (16%), and the US (65%).\\nCurrently, 80% of its owned generation capacity is emission-free; it has around 40 GW of installed renewable capacity across its portfolio.\\nThe Iberdrola Group intends to add 3 GW of renewables and invest over € bn in 2023.\\nOf the .\\n5 MW under construction (investments of ~€ bn), 0% are offshore wind, representing the UK (1.4 GW), EU (1,850 MW), and US (800 MW).\\nIn 2023-5, it plans to enter new partnerships for offshore wind, onshore wind/solar PV, thermal assets in Brazil, and Brazilian transmission.\\nThere are several OSW auctions the group is planning to bid in, including three in France this year for which Iberdrola has prequalified.\\nThe group also plans to bid in the Norwegian tender throughout the year and expects to take part in Polish auctions from 2025.\\nIt is developing its Japan R3 portfolio.\\nFrance: Saint-Brieuc (496 MW) commenced with underground cable installation in Q1 2023.\\nFoundations are being built, and commissioning is expected this year.\\nGermany: Iberdrola signed off on the sale of 49% of Wikinger (350 MW) in the Baltic Sea to Energy Infrastructure Partners (EIP) for € 00 m. Piles and jackets for the substation of Baltic Eagle (476 MW) have been installed.\\nThe substation is expected to be complete in Q1 2023, and turbines, foundations, and cables are expected by mid-2023.\\nUK: Divestment of the transmission assets for East Anglia 1 (714 MW) to Transmission Capital Partners was completed in December.\\nEast Anglia 3 (1.4 GW), which won a CfD in Round 4, has secured key contracts and carried out land research; it is moving to FID.\\nFinancials: Q4 2022 saw adjusted EBITDA decreased from C$364 m YoY to C$353 m, although full-year adjusted EBITDA was up from 202 ’s C$2,0 3 m to C$2,44 m. et income increased in Q4 to C$324 m (fwasC$130 m in Q4 2021).\\nAt its 2023 Investor Day Northland (NPI) provided guidance of C$1.2-1.3 bn, with 48% coming from offshore wind.\\nStrategy: 80% of NPI's C$1.3 bn turnover comes from renewables.\\nIt is targeting C$2.8-3 bn by 2030, with 90% from renewables.\\nNPI has expanded into six countries and sees future opportunities for battery storage, hydrogen (export & co-located), and floating wind in the 2030s.\\nThe next two years for NPI are about capturing 'tailwinds': the USA's IRA, Canada's proposed ITC, EU Green Deal/ RePowerEU, Energy Security and Corporate Net Zero goals.\\nBut strong headwinds exist: supply chain constraints mean contracts must be locked down earlier, driving up capital costs, alongside a tight labour market and higher financing costs.\\nThere has been a delay in these costs their way through to higher offtake contracts.\\nNPI reports cost inflation of 20-30% over past year.\\nAt Hai Long, having a CPPA layered on top of a UPPA has mitigated cost increases to some extent.\\nSimilarly, the Baltic Power project's CfD structure was changed, allowing NPI to redenominate into EUR with an earlier indexation date (Jan 2022), restoring project economics.\\nFor its Nordsee Cluster A, key supplier selection is underway and NPI expects higher costs to be offset by higher CPPA rates.\\nGoing forward, NPI's strategy involves a shift from project origination to execution, renewed focus on Canada, more sell-downs, more attention on corporate/industrial offtake, increased H2/storage, and a tightened focus on the most attractive markets.\\nIt is targeting a 12 GW capitalized renewables pipeline by 2030 (a four-fold increase).\\nIt currently has a 20 GW geographically diversified potential pipeline (60% offshore wind, 25% solar).\\nPriorities for offshore wind in 2023: Reach FID at Hai Long; Baltic Power financial close; lock down Nordsee Cluster A1 supply chain and offtake; advance the Korean and ScotWind projects; explore feasibility of green hydrogen to ammonia export opportunities in Atlantic Canada.\\nBattery storage demand increases with renewables: it is required for grid stability and replacing gas peaker plants.\\nOntario is expecting to offer up to 7 GW of RFPs over the next decade with 20–22-year contracts.\\nNPI is also evaluating colocation of batteries in US projects.\\nIn Ontario, it has invested with NRStor in a 250 MW/1,000 MWh project by Lake Erie, targeting COD in 2025.\\nGreen H2: NPI is focusing on wind to H2 projects with initial Canadian east coast focus.\\nThe east coast is endowed with high onshore wind speeds, access to freshwater, and land for ports nearby - a rare configuration, with government support.\\nPlans are to convert to ammonia for export.\\nThe EU plans to import 50 m tons of green ammonia by 2030, which would require 100 x 1 GW wind projects.\\nNPI is only aware of a dozen projects coming on in that timeframe.\\nNPI will develop the wind portion of projects and partner with entities for the fuel production and transport.\\nWind is 60% of cost base, but NPI will take equity in the whole project.\\nIt is also considering co-locating H2 at existing facilities as they come off subsidy, to create optionality.\\nFinance Strategy: Its long-term debt is non-recourse, fixed-rate, fixed-term, and at project-level linked to PPA returns.\\nThe currency is mostly matched to construction costs and debt hedged at financial close for full life of the loan in Europe.\\nProtection in Asia is 3-10 years.\\nIn 2023, it will issue its first corporate debt.\\nOil and gas: Equinor continues to invest in oil and gas, which provides strong revenue.\\nThe pipeline coming onstream in the next decade has a break-even price of $35 per barrel, yielding an internal return rate of around 30%.\\nIt anticipates a 3% production growth in its oil and gas in 2023, YoY.\\nCanada: The west coast is moving slowly.\\nNPI is working with regulators to develop a framework for Nova Scotia offshore wind (East Coast).\\nGermany: Nordsee Cluster A (Phase 1) (658 MW) is in procurement - moving towards turbine and T1 selection.\\nFID is expected in 2024, and COD in 2026.\\nNPI is seeking a PPA to cover cost increases.\\nThe auction for Cluster B (NS3 and Delta) is due in August 2023, and NPI expects to exercise step-in rights.\\nPoland: Baltic Power (1.2 GW) has preferred agreements and booking T&I for 15 MW Vestas turbines.\\nFID is expected in 2023 and COD in 2026.\\nSouth Korea: Dado (1 GW) received an EBL for 900 MW in 2022 (site exclusivity) and expects to start securing grid capacity in 2023.\\nBobae (600 MW), which has an EBL for 400 MW, is expecting an EBL for the balance in H1 2023.\\nSite investigation, project design, and grid agreement are planned for 2023.\\nTaiwan: Hai Long (1 GW) has FID delayed into 2023.\\nNPI has signed contracts for the majority of the project and commenced early works and fabrication to keep to schedule.\\nIt has also signed a strategic sell-down partnership with Gentari.\\nFinance was delayed by fallout from the rise in China-Taiwan tensions and delays at another of the lenders' Taiwan projects due to its accelerated schedule.\\nNPI had to reassure lenders of the differences.\\nProject viability for CanWind (500 MW) is confirmed – awarded in Round 3, with offtake via CPPA.\\nFinancials: In 2022, Ørsted achieved its highest ever EBITDA: Kr32.1 bn.\\nOf this, Kr11 bn was added by farming down 50% of the Hornsea 2 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 offshore wind farms.\\nROCE is reported at 17%, with net profit amounting to Kr15 bn.\\nWhile earnings from onshore wind, solar PV, heat & power plants, and gas were ‘significantly higher’ than expected, offshore earnings decreased, which Ørsted attributes to hedges and delays at Hornsea 2 and Greater Changhua 1 & 2a.\\nBy 2030, Ørsted is targeting 50 GW gross installed renewable capacity.\\nAs of end-2022, it has 15.1 GW installed, 4.3 GW under construction, and 11.2 GW awarded.\\nThe company will miss its intermediate target of 95% green generation in 2023 (the 2022 figure is 91%).\\nIt is aiming for 99% by 2025.\\nWhile 2022 saw a 7% decline in EBITDA from offshore wind, Ørsted expects it to grow to kr35-40 bn by 2027.\\nØrsted’s strategy is focussed on offshore wind, onshore renewables, and P2X.\\nIn offshore wind, Ørsted has locked in 90% of the cost of projects with COD before 2025.\\nIn P2X, the company has increased firm capacity by 4.5 GW in 2022 to 30.7 GW.\\nThe substantiated pipeline across onshore and offshore, and the opportunity pipeline in offshore has increased by over 25% to ~85 GW.\\nIn the EU, Ørsted is encouraged by increasing renewable targets and the ‘Fit-for-55’ programme with its focus on enabling carbon emissions reduction via increased renewables.\\nThe Green Deal Industrial Plan increases renewables’ attractiveness.\\nØrsted highlighted open door schemes across Europe and its new partnership with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to develop 5.2 GW in Danish open door projects.\\nHowever, these plans are in danger with the scheme’s sudden suspension this quarter.\\nIn Sweden, an emerging market, it has applied to build over 15 GW of offshore wind.\\nIn the US, the Inflation Reduction Act is, for Ørsted, a key long-term driver.\\nØrsted also notes the increased offshore wind targets along the US east coast, although it had to declare an impairment in the US with its Sunrise Wind project, due to rapid cost inflation.\\nØrsted sees potential opportunities in the Australia and APAC.\\nSweden: Ørsted has applied to build 15 GW of new offshore wind in Sweden.\\nIf approved, this capacity would be built out over the next ten years.\\nUS: Ørsted is assuming full ownership of its 1.1 GW Ocean Wind 1 project in New Jersey, with an agreement to acquire PSEG’s 25% share.\\nFinancials: Reported adjusted earnings for Q4 were $9.8 bn, with strong contributions from integrated gas.\\nIt was Shell's highest ever full-year results, with 2022 adjusted earnings of $40 bn, more than double those of last year, and around $17 bn higher than in 2014, when Brent prices were similar.\\nStrategy: Shell currently has 6.4 GW of renewables at post-FID, twice the level in 2021.\\nIt has 139,000 EV charge points, up 62% on 2021.\\nIt plans a CAPEX investments of $23-27 bn for 2023, with 30% (up from 21% in 2022) earmarked for its Energy Transmission activities in low-carbon energy ($2-4 bn) and non- energy products.\\nLow-carbon energy: Marketing (E-Mobility, EV charging services, low-carbon fuels) and Renewables & Energy Solutions (all business activities excluding trading and optimization of power and pipeline gas).\\nretailing and, lubricants production and sales) and C&P (chemicals production and sales).\\nIt is currently reviewing the status of its renewable energy/telecoms retail businesses in the UK, Netherlands, and Germany, which are loss-making, blaming poor structural market conditions in Europe - price caps, windfarm taxes and nationalisation.\\nIn response to declining returns in renewables, Shell is assessing renewables projects on the basis of (i) how each fits into its strategy and ii) the project's returns profile.\\nShell looks for projects it can differentiate and create specific returns on.\\nIt is sees good opportunities in biogas, moving molecules around and helping customers to decarbonize.\\nRenewables is switching to Shell's downstream division alongside Customers and Biofuels and EV charging - this will remove interfaces and assist in the delivery of decarbonised products.\\nFinancials: Offshore wind production was 22% below plan for the year, although up 20% YoY.\\nThe quarter saw unseasonably calm and dry weather, compounded by Seagreen delays.\\nStrategy: In December, regulator Ofgem decided to streamline the approval and funding process, and to exempt from competition the onshore grid connections required for the UK to deliver its 2030 offshore wind goals.\\nThis Accelerated Strategic Transmission Investment (ASTI) framework clears the way for SSEN to build the transmission assets within its scope.\\nUK: Construction on Seagreen continues (1.1 GW), alongside Dogger Bank and Viking, with Seagreen still expected to be completed in Summer 2023, assuming normal weather and planned vessel availability.\\nEarly scoping work is underway for Dogger Bank D (1.32 GW(, an Equinor/SSE JV located in existing acreage.\\nIt will export power via the grid or H2.\\nFinancials: Revenue for FY 2022 was up 33% to kr239.6 bn and underlying operating profit was up 20%.\\nThe wind business made a strong contribution due to new capacity (Kriegers Flak is now fully online) and higher prices.\\nHowever, lower prices were achieved in the Nordics and in trading, and lower clean spark spreads due to high gas prices impacted the heating business.\\nReported net profit was zero due to fair-value accounting effects of hedges, and lower Nuclear Waste Fund returns.\\nIn wind, revenues were up 39% and underlying operating profit up 109% due to higher prices and new capacity (240 MW onshore).\\nHeat sales increased by 74% but underlying profit decreased as higher gas prices could not be covered by higher electricity and heat revenues.\\nStrategy: Vattenfall is currently assessing feasibility of building a small modular reactor near its existing Ringhals site, has recently inaugrated a new biofuel- fired heat plant (Carpe Futurum) in Uppsala and has increased its EV charging points by 38% to nearly 40k Sweden: Vattenfall secured a competitive collaboration with Metsähallitus to build a 1.3 GW offshore wind farm in Finland (COD early 2030s).\\nFrance: In November, Vattenfall submitted a bid with Skyborn and CDC for a 1 GW offshore tender.\\nA decision is expected this quarter.\\nNetherlands: HKZ Sud has reached first power, with COD due later in 2023.\\nEDF Renewables: EDF Renewables has bought up Newcastle Offshore Wind, a 10 GW floating wind project planned for New South Wales, Australia.\\nThe project has been planned over the past decade by Newcastle Offshore Wind Energy Pty Ltd.\\nThe intention is to build it in stages as the government extends its public ambition.\\nEversource: Last year, Eversource conducted a strategic review of its 50/50 partnership with Ørsted in the US.\\nThis involved engaging with potential buyers for some or all of its stake.\\nThe review is in its due diligence phase and an update is expected in Q3 2023.\\nEven if it withdraws from offshore wind development, Eversource will continue to buy offshore wind electricity, as a utility.\\nTotalEnergies: TotalEnergies has joined forces with Corio to take forward the Formosa 3 projects – Haiding 1,2, and 3, totalling 2 GW – in Taiwan.\\nThe partners have already worked together in the UK, France, and South Korea.\\nØrsted now has more pre-FID and post-FID Net project capacity (GW) for leading developers\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}',

approved the grid operator RTE’s (Réseau de Transport d'Électricité) €1.88 bn investment plan for 2023, with an increase of ~9% compared to 2022 (€1.72 bn).\\nThe 2023 €486 m for the renewal of the existing RTE network; €448 m for the reinforcement and creation of infrastructure to accommodate new electricity production and consumption €292 m for the connection of offshore wind parks; €110m for the development of new interconnectors (table).\\nThe budget for interconnectors might not be enough for supporting interconnector projects, but it is almost double than RTE interconnectors budget of €56 m in 2022.\\nBiscay Gulf Interconnector (2 GW): French and Spanish TSOs, RTE and REE have informed their respective energy regulators that project cost has increased due to inflation.\\nIn 2017, French and Spanish energy regulators, CRE and Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) agreed that RTE and REE would equally share the €1,750 m investment costs and that €350 m from the European subsidy would be allocated to RTE, in order to compensate for the insufficient benefits for France.\\nIn addition, any additional cost overrun beyond this amount would be divided 62.5% by REE and 37.5% by RTE.\\nThe project promoters subsequently obtained a European grant under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for €578 m. In February 2023, it was announced that costs have increased to €2,390 m, with REE to bear €1494 m (62.5%) and RTE will pay €896 m (37.5%).\\nEPC contracts, for the ~1,600 km of offshore and onshore HVDC cables have been awarded to NKT and Prysmian Cables.\\nIn addition, the EPC contract for the converter stations has been awarded to the HITACHI ENERGY/VINCI consortium.\\nThe EPC tender for civil works associated with the onshore cables is ongoing, with awards later this year.\\nCeltic Interconnector: Ireland and France have signed technical and financial agreements to develop this project.\\nConstruction is expected from 2023, with completion in 2027.\\nNexans has been awarded a turnkey contract for 1000 km HVDC subsea cables, with XLPE insulation, and 180 km underground cables.\\nTotal project cost is €1.623 bn.\\nFunding of €800 m has been granted by European Investment Bank (EIB), Danske Bank, BNP and Barclays, in addition to a grant of €530.7 m under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).\\n€404 m will be financed by RTE (Réseau de Transport d’Electricité).\\nUK and France have signed a new partnership, which will enhance further collaboration on energy between the two countries.\\nBoth the countries currently have three interconnectors totaling 4 1 GW ElecLink that was commissioned in 2022; 1GW IFA2 commissioned in 2020; and 2 GW IFA2000 that is operational since 1986.\\nThe new energy agreement could support an increase in electricity interconnection between UK and France by up to two thirds, subject to regulatory approval.\\nAt present, there are four interconnectors planned between the two countries, namely: 2GW Aquind interconnector, 1.4 GW Fablink, 1.4 GW GridLink and 700 MW Kulizumboo interconnector.\\n~6,340 km cable is expected

growth potential (based on government ambition, developer interest, strength of regime, route to market, supply chain and supporting infrastructure), with the most credible projects in the pipeline such that the sum of the project capacity approximates to the analysts predicted growth potential.\\nThis is usually less than the country’s targeted ambition.\\n▪ Projects Excluded: Projects have been excluded where developer interest exceeds the realistic growth potential, e.g., due to high levels of competition between projects for power contracts or grid connections.\\n▪ Costs: Known contracts since 2015 have been inflated to 2022 prices.\\nNo future inflation or industry cost reductions have been considered.\\n▪ Unit Costs: Cable manufacturing cost in China have been assumed as 80% of European cost, and installation cost is only 39% of Europe.\\n▪ Review of Global Interconnector Markets: Private sector projects, TSO plans, Supranational bodies (ENTSOE), media & direct contact on a continuous basis.\\n▪ Scope includes the following cable use cases; 1. International Interconnectors (e.g., UK-France) 2.\\nDomestic Interconnections (Island Groups, Mainland-Mainland, Mainland- 4.\\nOil and Gas Electrification Projects ▪ Time period: Offshore installation expected to begin in the period Q2-2023 to end- 2032.\\n▪ Projects included are rated medium/high certainty by the analyst according to evidence of likelihood to proceed in the time period (inclusion in TSO plans, permitting progress, route to market, project activity).\\n▪ Cables from 65 countries meet the criteria.\\n▪ Length (km) has been calculated as subsea route length * number of cables.\\n▪ EPCI costs have been modelled using average since 2015, inflated to end-2022 prices.\\nCable Costs for all Projects  Cable Demand: 2023 to 2032 (Interconnectors and Offshore Wind) Total cable demand is expected to reach ~157,490 km, of which ~62,246 km will be installed in interconnector projects, and ~95,250 km in offshore wind projects (top right).\\n~72,780 km HVDC cables are expected to be deployed on offshore wind and interconnector project.\\nPlease note that HVDC demand also includes 15,200 km cable for X-Links project, who are expected to manufacture this cable in their own cable factory (top right).\\n~46,100 km MVAC and ~38,640 km HVAC cables are expected to be deployed on interconnectors and offshore wind projects by in 2023-32 (top right).\\nHVDC cable expenditure (~59 bn) is more than other cables, followed by HVAC cables (~46 bn) and MVAC cables (~34 bn) (top left).\\nIn the bottom two charts, cable demand has been further classified as <145 kV and >=145 kV for both AC and DC current in interconnectors and offshore wind projects.\\nThis classification assumes that higher voltage requires more specialized equipment – i.e., a Vertical Lay Machine to ensure concentricity.\\nAround 95,245 km cable is expected to be required for offshore wind projects, of which ~84% is AC.\\n~46,400 km AC cable <145 kV, while ~33,100 km AC cable will

exclusive dynamic cable analysis.\\nAround 36,000 km cable has been installed in offshore wind project around the world, and further, ~95,250 km is expected to be installed between Q2-2023 to 2032.\\nIn Europe, ~44,300 km cable is expected to be installed between Q2-2023 to 2032,of which~26% (11,500 km) will be installed in UK, followed by 24% in Germany (10,470 km) and 15% in Netherlands (6,760).\\n(top left).\\nTo date, ~16,263 km cable has been installed in Europe in offshore wind projects, which will almost quadruple in 2032 with growing demand.\\nThe installed cable in China (16,856 km) is more than cable installed in whole Europe (16,263 km).\\nChina is expected to have a consistently high demand (~23,400 km) for cables in the next 10 years, mostly supplied by their own manufacturers (e.g.\\nZTT, Orient, Hengtong).\\n(top right) APAC is an emerging offshore wind market, where ~2,370 km cable has been installed to date, but ~12,600 km cable is expected to be deployed between Q2-2023 to 2032.\\n(bottom left) South Korea (4,200 km) and Taiwan (4,165 km) are the biggest demand centres in APAC.\\nMost of South Korea’s demand is comprised of dynamic cables, which is discussed in slide 17.\\nIn Americas, USA is the fastest growing offshore wind market, with~14,800 km cables expected to be installed in the next ten years, which is more than any European or APAC country, but less than China.\\nAround 23,400 cable will be deployed in China China: Installed cable (km) by Q1-2023 vs expected total demand by 2032 ~15,00 cable will be required in Americas

is the biggest demand centre, followed by Germany Europe: Installed cable (km) by Q1-2023 vs expected total demand by 2032  Around 63,246 km cable is expected to be installed on interconnector projects in Q2 2023- 2032 around the world.\\nTo date, ~29,800 km cable has been installed in interconnector projects around the world, of which 78% (23,299 km) has been installed in Europe.\\nEurope will be consistently the biggest demand centre for cables in interconnector projects, with ~41,700 km expected to be installed in Q2-2023 to 2032 (top right).\\nTo date, Norway has installed the most cable (~4,630 km), major part of which has been installed in oil and gas electrification projects (i.e., Johan Sverdrup, Martin Linge etc).\\n(Left chart) United Kingdom is expected to install the most cable in Q2-2023-2032.\\nSome significant international projects include: X- links (15,200 km) between UK and Morocco, Fablink (680 km) in UK and France, NeuConnect (1440 km) in Germany and UK.\\nUK has a huge cable demand from its domestic projects, including: Eastern Green Link (880 km) , Sea Link (280 km), E4L5 Link (900 km) etc.\\nThe domestic demand also comprises some interconnectors included in its grid plan, e.g.\\nDogger Bank South- West to East HVAC (120 km).\\nA consistent growth trend can be observed in the interconnectors cable market over the time.\\nOverall, the subsea cable market for interconnectors is expected to reach ~92,000 km by 2032 (right bottom).\\n14.9 16.5 18.2 19.3 21.9 24.6 25.3 26.0 28.9 29.7 31.2 34.7 Three times increase in installed cable is expected in interconnector projects by 2032 Cumulative Interconnectors Cable, Installed (km) by Q1-2023 to Forecasted by 2032 UK requires the most cable for domestic and international projects Installed cable (km) by Q1-2023 vs expected demand by 2032 in each Country Europe will remain the biggest demand centre for interconnector cables Interconnectors: Installed cable (km) by Q1-2023 vs expected total demand by 2032  Reconciling the Q3-2022 and Q1-2023 Forecasts Overall cable demand has increased in this forecast, due to 31 more offshore wind and 8 more grid projects added to it, compare to the previous forecast.\\nThe future windfarms (mostly in the second half of the forecast) are likely to be further away from shore, which has partly caused an increase in the export cable demand.\\nIn addition, more windfarm projects have also increased the export cable demand.\\nMore and bigger windfarms, using more turbines have increased the array cable demand over the time.\\n10 new shared platforms in UK, USA, Germany and Netherlands have been included in Q1-2023 forecast, which have caused an increase in grid cable demand.\\n2 platforms from previous forecast are not included because of being entered in construction phase.\\nExport cables have caused an increase in HVAC cable demand.\\nMVAC demand has been mainly increased due to surge in array cable demand.\\nThe HVDC demand has increased due to new shared platforms in forecast and emerging trend of using HVDC export cables in distant windfarms, mostly in late 2020s or 2030s.\\nThe increase in subsea cable demand for interconnectors has been caused by 23 new interconnector projects in Q1-2023 forecast; of which, 15 are HVDC and 8 are HVAC (see details below).\\nFrom the previous forecast, 14 HVAC projects of ~570 km length have already entered construction phase and not included in this forecast.\\nThe Q1-2023 forecast includes 8 new HVAC projects of ~300 km length.\\nFuture interconnector projects are less likely to use HVAC technology, which is causing a decrease in HVAC demand in interconnectors.\\nMVAC is not a preferred technology for interconnectors; therefore, trend of using it is gradually finishing.\\nIt is used either in very small projects or O&G electrification projects.\\nThere has been a great surge in HVDC interconnector projects, which has substantially increased HVDC cables forecast.\\nThis forecast comprises 15 new HVDC projects compare to previous one, including, 15,200 km X-Links project, 3200 km India- Middle East interconnector, 2000 km Singapore- Cambodia project, etc.\\n23 new projects of ~27,490 km cable length have been added to Q1-2023 forecast.\\nWhile, 18 projects of 845 km length from the previous forecast have not being included because of completing cable installation phase.\\nThis analysis is based on expected dynamic cable demand between 2023-35.\\nDynamic cable demand data until 2032 has been taken from the over all demand on slide 12 & 13.\\nAround 5,120 km dynamic cable is expected to be required for floating wind projects, between 2023-35; including, ~5,038 km array cables (MVAC) and only ~87 km export cables (MVAC and HVAC), (top right& middle).\\nThe biggest demand will likely emerge from Europe (France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway Portugal, Spain & UK), followed by APAC (Australia, Japan, South Korea, Philippines & Taiwan), Americas (United States & Brazil) and China.\\n(left & bottom South Korea will be the biggest demand centre of Dynamic cables with ~1,302 km dynamic cable required between 2023-35.\\n(left chart) In addition, emerging trend of oil and gas electrification may also add to the dynamic cables demand.\\nThe cost of dynamic cables is still under consideration.\\nSince, it does not require outer lead, so it can be cheaper than static cables; however, it requires a lot of accessories to install, which can make it four times more pricey than static cables.\\nDynamic cables demand is expected to reach ~5,120 km by 2035 Cumulative Dynamic Cables Demand (km) 2023- 35 Dynamic Cables Demand (km) 2023- 35 by Country 98% dynamic cables will be required for array projects Total Dynamic Cables Demand (km) 2023- 35 by Project Type Most demand is expected to emerge from Europe Dynamic Cables Demand (km) 2023- 35 by Georegion  Forecast: Dedicated Platforms in 2023- 32 ▪ The forecast only predicts demand for offshore dedicated platforms and does not include share platforms.\\nIn APAC & China, 4C models one substation for each 500 MW.\\nIn US and Europe, 4C models one substation for every 1100 MW.\\nNote that some nearshore projects may not have substations if they connect straight to shore.\\nAnd other projects may alternatively connect to an offshore grid.\\n▪ Globally, ~445 platforms are expected to be deployed in 2023-32, ~204 platforms of 1100 MW platforms, and ~241 of 500 MW (Top left).\\n▪ Of total 445 substations, ~161 will be installed in the first half of forecast, while ~284 in the second half.\\nThe increase in demand in the 2nd half is caused by more countries (like Lithuania, Poland, Italy, etc.)\\nexpected to start their offshore wind farms in that time period (top left).\\n▪ Of total, 401 substations are expected to be AC and only 44 substations will be DC (bottom right).\\n▪ There will be a small but consistent demand for DC platforms throughout the forecast period (2023-32), which will gain strength in 2030s (bottom left), with DC demand coming from Europe and Americas only (e.g., Dogger Bank B&C in UK and Sunrise wind in Americas).\\n64% substation demand in post 2027 period Total platform demand, by georegion Platforms demand, by current type DC platforms will cover ~10% of market Total Platform demand, by current type Europe and China will remain the biggest demand centres for substations Total Platform demand, by georegion  The platform topsides market shares analysis includes 175 platform topside contracts for both shared and dedicated platform, which are deployed/expected to be deployed between 2002- 2029.\\nSmulders has been contracted for the most

Permits But Schedule Delayed Elia submitted an application for a 20-year environmental permit and a Natura 2000 permit for the construction and operation of the world’s first energy island.\\nThe application is handled by the Scientific Service MUMM (Management Unit of the Mathematical Model of the North Sea) and four-week public inquiry closed 10th March.\\nEnergy Island is designed to connect 3.15-3.5 GW offshore wind from the PEZ.\\nThree tender lots have been confirmed for 700 MW, 1,225- 1,400 MW, and 1,225-1,400 MW.\\nPublication of the first tender originally scheduled for end-2023, is now not expected until late 2024, with first operations from end-2028.\\nTenders for Lots 2 and 3 are now expected 2026-2028, with commissioning from 2030.\\nThe schedule is contingent on the progress of reinforcement of the Ventilus: a 380 kV voltage line will connect wind energy from the North Sea to a new electricity highway between Zeebrugge and Avelgem with capacity to carry 6 GW.\\nThe permitting process is in its very early scoping phase.\\nThe administrative procedure for obtaining the permits will start next year and expected to take three years.\\nScheduled to be completed 2028-2030.\\nBoucle du Hainaut: a 380 kV, 85 km-long overhead connection between Avelgem and Courcelles, passing through 14 municipalities.\\nThe EIA has been cleared to commence, following modification of the Walloon Regional Plan.\\nPermit applications are expected to take two years, followed by three-year construction window, with COD 2029-2030.\\nLocated approximately 45 km off the coast, the energy island will have a footprint of 0.25 km², including erosion protection (usable area is limited to 0.05 to 0.06 km²).\\nThe precise location is still under consideration.\\nLocation West 1 was selected as the most suitable location for the construction of the island due to shallowest water depths; and favourable cable lengths to the windfarms and shore.\\nWest 2 and North are alternative island locations and there is the option for four traditional AC/DC platforms.\\nThe choice of cable route and landing zone is also ongoing and linked to onshore grid expansion plans for the Ventilus project (map).\\nConstructed from 25 concrete caissons measuring, 50-70 m long, 20-25 m wide and 20-25 m high, that will be filled with 17,000 m3 sand (per caisson) and 2,400,000 m3 sand to infill the middle.\\nThis sand will be extracted in the immediate vicinity of the island, in places where erosion is expected to occur due to the presence of the island ('pre- trenching').\\nThe island must provide functionalities for: mooring facility for CTVs and supply vessels; refuelling and bunkering; water and waste storage facilities; storage / storage room / warehouse; common areas / offices / control rooms; heliport; road infrastructure; etc (image).\\nTransmission infrastructure i.e.\\nsubstations and converters are centralised in the energy island.\\n2.1 GW is transported to land via six 220kV three-phase AC export cables and 1.4-2 GW via one HVDC cable system.\\nThe island will also connect to the United Kingdom (Nautilus) and Denmark (Triton Link).\\nWindfarms will connect via 66kV.\\nIt is based on a modular concept, to allow realization in multiple phases, synchronized with the timing of the various wind farms and interconnectors and with onshore grid reinforcement projects, some preparatory works (such as UXO identification and removal) may take place in 2023 and construction of the Island structure will start available from Energy Island now not expected until Q2 2028, with first turbines from Lot 1 tender generating power from Q4 2028.\\nThe island is designed for a lifespan of 100 years, and 50 years for the electrical infrastructure.\\nIt is likely that at the end of the 20-year period an extension will be sought.\\nIn March 2022, the federal government took a decision in principle on a package of measures aimed at guaranteeing Belgium's security of supply and reducing its dependence on fossil fuels.\\nOne measure proposed to launch a study to increase ambition for 8 GW renewable production capacity at sea.\\nIncreased capacity could be implemented by: Identification of new offshore wind zones, although Belgium is somewhat spatially limited, so capacity could also be achieved through accelerated repowering of the first offshore wind zone.\\nInstallation of floating solar panels.\\nBelgian authorities will refine the above ambitions and formalize into legislation.\\nThe Marine Spatial Plan will be updated for 2026.\\nIn parallel, Elia will launch new studies to identify grid reinforcement requirements.\\nFor repowering, infrastructure needs to be optimized and bottlenecks removed, e.g.\\nstrengthening the Gezelle - Van Maerlant axis and an additional 220 kV offshore cable from the MOG.\\nCurrently there is 2.2 GW capacity over 177 km2 in the first Belgian offshore wind zone, with the oldest projects

Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island – have requested Department of Energy (DOE) funding to support a transmission solicitation.\\nThe proposal is called a ‘Joint Innovation State Partnership for Offshore Wind’.\\nThe DOE, which requested concept papers, is authorized to fund up to $2 bn (€1.85 bn) in the 2023 financial year, including up to $250 m (€232 m) per project.\\nThe New England States Transmission Initiative has requested funding to support ‘innovative electricity transmission proposals’ for one to three HVDC lines.\\nThe states would work with ISO New England in a process similar to that seen under New Jersey and PJM’s State Agreement Approach.\\nThe call would also request solutions to incorporate a meshed multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) system, something that has so far only been commercially deployed in China (see image, top).\\nAs reported in the Q4 2022 Cables and Grid report, the four states plus New Hampshire joined forces last year, requesting information on how potential offshore wind transmission solicitations should work.\\nStrong Response to New York’s Call for HVDC, The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) closed its 2022 offshore wind solicitation in Q1 and will announce results by Q3 2023.\\nIt received over 100 bids representing eight proposed projects from six developers, with project sizes up to 3

has been set, but to meet the 100% target the Swedish Energy Agency anticipates 10-45 TWh of offshore wind.\\nTSO Svenska Kraftnät has found that Sweden needs between three and six new grid connection points for new build-out, focusing first around Skåne.\\nNo support scheme exists as yet, and market uncertainty is high.\\nCoupled with the government’s staratgey to push for nuclear energy.\\nTechnology was not seen as favourable in recent referenda in municipality of Söderhamn.\\nBrazil: The government’s energy plan includes a high scenario of 16 GW by 2050 but this is not a formal goal.\\nIt is unclear how the new administration will approach offshore wind but it is expected to embrace it.\\nDecree 10.946 regulates the construction and operation of offshore wind projects in Brazilian waters, including domestic and territorial waters, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and on the continental shelf.\\nThe Ministry of Mines and Energy has published draft rules for auctions, but the full framework is not expected before H2 2023.\\n4C anticipates a slow initial build-out, concentrated around key large ports that may make green hydrogen attractive.\\nUnited States: Federal-level targets include 30 GW by 2030 and net-zero by 2050.\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act translates ambition to policy and federal support The Department of the Interior has accelerated its leasing and consenting activities.\\nHowever, an immature supply chain and port and grid infrastructure requirements may see some delays.\\nProgress is largely state-driven.\\nState targets are getting bigger and longer-term.\\nNew York is expected to double its 9 GW by 2035 goal, while most recently California announced a 25 GW by 2045 target.\\nFixed-bottom wind on the east coast will build out first, followed by deeper floating wind in the Gulfs of Maine and Mexico, and the west coast into the 2030s.\\nFirst floating leases auctioned in Q4 2022.\\nAustralia: The government aims to increase renewable electricity generation from 29% (2021) to 82% by 2030 and net zero by 2050.\\nVictoria is the first state to set offshore wind targets, for at least 2 GW by 2032, with a procurement round in mid-2020s and first power in 2028, and 4 GW by 2035.\\nThe first licensing round off Gippsland was launched Q1 2023.\\nDeclaration of a second area off Hunter is underway.\\nClarity is needed around offtake schemes, grid connections, ports and supply chain development.\\n4C has modelled buildout to 2035 but projects, locations, and start years are illustrative and dependent and federal and state progress and supply chain development.\\nChina: Following a large build-out in 2021, 4C expects a short-term slow-down until there is clarity on provincial level subsidy mechanisms and targets.\\nBy the end of 2022, the total installed capacity of offshore wind power in China reached 30 GW, an increase of approximately 4 GW compared to 2021.\\nRegional governments are announcing 14th Five-Year Plans and have released some competitive allocation projects and sites and targets.\\nIn 2022, several provinces added multiple GW targets for grid connection by 2025 and 2030, adding to its enormous total capacity.\\nDue to nature of five-year plans, there is limited visibility for long-term ambitions hence 4C anticipates a growing pipeline.\\nIndia has increased its already unrealistic 2030 target from 30 GW to 37 GW.\\nProgress is delayed due to a lack of funding and legal and political frameworks.\\nIndia’s first tender is expected to include 4 GW of potential capacity.\\nProjects will be given up to 7 years to assess sites.\\nGiven lead times for site studies and planning, 4C estimates that India will develop up to 4 GW offshore wind energy by 2035, with tenders in the mid-2020s.\\nJapan’s forecast has been increased by 300 MW, given stronger confidence in the market, following the launch of the Round 2 auctions in December 2022 and willingness from the government to extend the legal framework to cover the EEZ, thus allowing projects to be developed beyond the current 12 nautical mile from shore limit.\\nMore clarity is needed, however, on future auction sites and the timeframe for projects to be developed in the EEZ for more confident capacity estimates beyond 2030.\\nSouth Korea is still targeting 12 GW offshore wind by 2030 but will amend this target.\\nConsidering the reduction in the RE target for 2030 from the Moon administration, it is plausible for the target to be lowered.\\nStrong projects progress each quarter, such as BP and Deep Wind Offshore’s 6 GW pipeline, Northland’s newly announced 1.8 GW Wando, and Equinor’s multi-GW Jeju commitment.\\nHowever, the country is still burdened by a complicated and time-consuming permitting regime.\\nSimplifying procedures (e.g.\\nwith the one-stop shop bill and offshore wind specific MSPs) will be necessary to accommodate for immense developer-side demand and accelerate development.\\nTaiwan is targeting 5.6 GW by 2025, adding a further 1.5 GW per year between 2026 and 2035, reaching 20.6 GW by 2035 and 40-55 GW by 2050.\\nTaiwan is still hampered by its COVID-19-related delays, despite speed of project progress being in the ascendency, the backlog may be too great to overcome by 2025 to meet the original aim.\\nAnticipated small scale floating demos towards 2030.\\nVietnam: The eighth Power Development Plan (PDP8) is expected to include an offshore wind target of 7 GW by 2030.\\nPDP8 has been consistently delayed.\\n4C assumes further delays to policy, tendering, and construction processes.\\nAdditionally, grid constraints could cause delays and curtailment.\\nClarity is needed on regulations and support mechanisms, following the expiration of the feed-in-tariff (FiT) in October 2021.\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),

is fully commissioned.\\nChina leads with 24.3 GW, followed by the UK (13.7 GW) and Germany (7.6 GW).\\nChina also has the most under construction (7.7 GW), which is up on last quarter, followed by the UK (2.8 GW).\\nThe UK (3.9 GW), Germany (1.6 GW), and China (1.6 GW) have the most post-FID in pre-construction.\\nGlobally, a cumulative 83.4 GW is operational, in construction or has made FID.\\nThe increase is 2.2 GW on the last quarter.\\nIn order to meet 2030 targets, an increasing FID rate of 4.5 GW/quarter (exc.\\nChina) is needed.\\nCurrently, 4C’s POP plots a top-end credible growth of an additional 170.6 GW by 2030, with a CAGR of 15.7%, taking the total global offshore activity (operational or foundations underway) to 268 GW by end-2030.\\nAround 229 GW of this is high or medium confidence.\\nEmergent growth is expected to be strongest in China, US, Germany, UK, and the Netherlands.\\nThe 2030 outlook is down 3 GW on last quarter, reflecting the volatile price of energy and increased supply chain costs, which have impacted project timelines in most markets, and some government ambition shifting to shorter-term solutions.\\nA peak in buildout is expected in Europe around 2030 as governments amp up expansion targets, which has been influenced by the fall out of the invasion of Ukraine and the energy crisis.\\nHowever, time frames are tight and most countries are aiming for regulatory reform to streamline processes.\\nThere may also be increased pressure on supply chains and transmission grids, and heightened risk associated with variable market dynamics and inflation.\\n4C’s POP extends to 2035, with a global outlook of 426 GW (not shown here, see database).\\nPipelines post-2030 are expected to be given more clarity as markets progress.\\n4C Offshore forecasts that 14.1 GW of floating offshore wind capacity will be installed or underway globally by 2030 and 63 GW by 2035.\\nVessel Activity Analysis, rolling year 2022 4C has analysed the rolling year vessel activity.\\nSaipem 3000 had the highest activity with 303 days installing 30 piles on Neart na Gaoithe.\\nDelays occurred due to a more challenging sea bed than anticipated.\\nAeolus comes second with 266 days spent on Saint- Brieuc, where the vessel installed 12 jackets and completed the drilling campaign for 40 foundations.\\nINNOVATION comes third with 265 days spent across Kaskasi, Hollandse Kust Noord, and Dogger Bank A.\\nSee slide 11 for installation rate analysis.\\nWind Orca had the highest activity with 293 days spent installing 24 turbines on Seagreen.\\nSeajacks Scylla comes second with 275 days spent installing 41 turbines on Greater Changhua.\\nBrave Tern comes third with 195 days spent on Formosa II installing 13 turbines.\\nBold Tern re-joined the market in April after a crane upgrade, hence the low turbine installation days.\\nBokalift 2 joined the market in May, hence the low foundation installation days.\\nSeaway Yudin has been between ports in Singapore since September.\\nSea Installer spent time in port ahead of a major crane upgrade taking place in February 2023.\\nNote: 4C queried MarineTraffic for the missing data but no AIS data is available.\\nIt is likely that vessels turned off their signal when they were at the port.\\n7011 days of offshore wind activity Number of contracted days in offshore wind by activity
